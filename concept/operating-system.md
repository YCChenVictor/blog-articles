# Title

## Purpose

Understanding low-level computer operations is essential for computer engineering, software development, and information technology professionals to develop efficient software applications, manage computer systems, and enhance security against external threats.

## Concept

### Overview

Operating System serves as the communicator between computer hardware and computer software applications.

```

When a job or task is initiated from an application, the operating system's process management component handles the creation of a new process, allocating necessary resources through the kernel, managing memory and CPU usage, coordinating I/O operations through device drivers, and providing an interface for user interaction, all while ensuring the overall stability and efficiency of the system.

### Process Management

It involves the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes. It also includes inter-process communication and synchronization. Refer to [process management](/os/process-management).

### memory management

It involves keeping track of each byte in a system's memory and which processes are using which memory. It decides which processes to load when memory space becomes available.

### device management

It involves managing all the device controllers to monitor every device, channel, and control unit. It's responsible for the communication between devices.

### file management

It involves the creation, deletion, and access of files. It also provides mechanisms for creating directories and managing disk space.

### security Management

It involves protecting the system's resources and data from unauthorized access and providing a secure way for users to access the system.

### Network Management

This involves managing network connections and network security.

### User Interface Management

This involves managing how users interact with the system, either through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).

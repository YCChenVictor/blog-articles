## Introduction

This article explains how to include react in jekyll.

## Why?

I want to create a sidebar in my gh page.

## How?

### init

Actually, we can just follow [Using Webpack and React with Jekyll](https://medium.com/@allizadrozny/using-webpack-and-react-with-jekyll-cfe137f8a2cc)

The concept is to let webpack pack all assets (javascript, css, etc) and import it with bundle.js

### install

run ls to know what dependency lost

```
npm ls
```

and `npm i xxx`

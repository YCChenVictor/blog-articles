## Introduction

N+1 query problem happens when there are N queries depends on 1 query; for example, given model relation that user has many blog posts. Given we are in the loop of posts. if we want to retrieve all the author name, intuitively, we may compose ORM command as follow:

```ruby
Post.all.each do |post| puts post.user.name end
```

and the SQL command looks like as follow:

```SQL
SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 2], ["LIMIT", 1]]
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 2], ["LIMIT", 1]]
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 33], ["LIMIT", 1]]
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 4], ["LIMIT", 1]]
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 4], ["LIMIT", 1]]
...
```

We can notice that there are two posts from user 2, one post from user 33, and two posts from user 4, ...etc, which cause by that we ask computer to look for user one by one according to posts, so the solution should tell computer to just query `posts` and `users` once and compose and show the results we want afterwards, going to reduce the SQL commands as folow:

```SQL
SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IN (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["id", 2], ["id", 4], ["id", 33]]
```

## Why?

We want server side to prepare data as quick as possible.

## How?

try to answer how include works

## What?

In rails, we solve it with includes and join

* N + 1

```ruby
Benchmark.measure do
  ActivityStudent.all.each do |activity| puts activity.student.name end
end
```

* includes

```ruby
Benchmark.measure do
  ActivityStudent.includes(:student).all.each do |activity| puts activity.student.name end
end
```

* joins

```ruby
Benchmark.measure do
  ActivityStudent.joins(:student).all.each do |activity| puts activity.student.name end
end
```

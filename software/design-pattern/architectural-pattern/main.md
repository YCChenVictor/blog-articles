* [Model-View-Controller (MVC)]
* [Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)](/blog/software/design-pattern/event-driven): Event-Driven Architecture is a design pattern that focuses on the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events in a software system. Components of a system communicate asynchronously by producing and consuming events. This pattern enables loosely coupled and highly scalable systems, where components can react to events in real-time without needing to know the internal workings of other components.
* [Microservices]
* [Layered Architecture]

### Prisoner Dilemma

| P1 \ p2 | Confess | Silent |
| :---  | :----: | :---: |
| Confess | 4 \ 4 | 1 \ 5 |
| Silent | 5 \ 1 | 2 \ 2 |

* ISP routing game: There are two ISP both do not know their counterpart's strategy. 
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    subgraph ISP1
      core1(core1)
      s1(s1)
      t2(t2)
    end

    c(transit point C)
    s(transit point S)

    subgraph ISP2
      core2(core2)
      s2(s2)
      t1(t1)
    end
    
    s1 <---> c
    s2 <---> c
    core1 <---> s1
    core1 <---> s
    core2 <---> s2
    core2 <---> s
    t1 -.- s
    t2 -.- s
  ```
  * Note that t1 and t2 are extremely near transit pint S.
  * Explanation: ISP 1 would like to send information from s1 to t1. In big picture, ISP 1 should use transit point S because the total cost would be 2 (core 1 -> transit point S -> t1). However, it means all the cost lies on ISP 1. Given both ISPs just want to send the information to their counterpart at lowest cost, ISP 1 would choose the route (s1 -> C) and let ISP 2 to do the rest job. As a result, the total cost would be 4, which is worse as a whole.

### Tragedy of Commons

#### Pollution game

The Pollution Game is a simplified version of the Tragedy of the Commons, often used in economics and game theory to illustrate the dynamics of environmental degradation caused by individual self-interest.

In the Pollution Game, imagine a scenario where multiple factories are located on the banks of a river, and each factory has the choice to either pollute or clean up its waste before discharging it into the river. The river serves as a shared resource, and the pollution level in the river affects all factories downstream.

* Players: There are multiple players, representing the factories located along the river.
* Actions: Each player has two actions to choose from:
  * Pollute: The player can choose to discharge its waste into the river without treating it, leading to increased pollution.
  * Clean Up: The player can choose to invest in pollution control measures to treat its waste before discharging it into the river, reducing pollution levels.
* Payoffs: The payoffs for each player depend on the collective actions of all players:
  * If all players choose to clean up (cooperate), the river remains clean, benefiting everyone with a high payoff.
  * If a player chooses to pollute while others clean up, that player benefits from lower costs but imposes costs on others due to increased pollution downstream.
  * If all players choose to pollute (defect), the river becomes highly polluted, resulting in low payoffs for everyone due to the environmental damage.
* Model:
  * Pollution control has a cost of 3 for each firm. If other firms pollutes the river, they add 1 cost to the other firms. Suppose k firms choose not to control pollution. Then these k firms have k cost and the other n-k firms have k+3 cost.
  * If a firm choose not to control pollution, it will have k+3 cost; however, if the firm choose pollute the river, it will have k cost. As a result, it will choose pollution. In the end, all the firms' cost will be n because all the firms choose pollution.

The key insight from the Pollution Game is that individual rationality (choosing to pollute) often leads to a collectively undesirable outcome (high pollution), similar to the Tragedy of the Commons. However, if players can coordinate their actions and cooperate by investing in pollution control measures, they can achieve a better outcome for all.

#### Tragedy of the commons

There are contradiction between a player's benefit and the total benefits of other players.

Say there is a bandwidth with maximum capacity of 1. Each player i send `x_i` amount of data. As a result, all users benefit will be 0 if

$$\sum_j(x_j) > 1$$

And it is also straight forward to formulate the return of player_i among other players as

$$x_i(1 - \sum_j(x_j))$$

where

$$\sum_n(x_n) < 1$$

Let's get the steady state. Say the total benefit of all the other player is `t` and at the same time player send x amount of data, then the benefit of player i would be

$$x(1 - t - x)$$

Then the maximum benefit would occur when

$$x_i = \frac{1 - \sum_(j!=i)(x_j)}{2}$$

Say all players have the same benefit, then you will find

$$x_i = \frac{1}{(1+n)}$$

### Coordination Games

A basic coordination game entails two participants who have two choices to make, with the objective of making the same selection.

#### Battle of The Sexes

Boys prefer baseball and girls prefer softball, but they need each other so that they can play the game. So the payoff:

| Girl \ Boy | Baseball | Softball |
| :---  | :----: | :---: |
| Baseball | 5 \ 6 | 1 \ 1 |
| Softball | 2 \ 2 | 6 \ 5 |

Given girls choose softball, boys will choose softball. Also, given girls choose baseball, boys choose baseball. There are two Nash Equ. both baseball or both softball.

#### Randomized Strategies

| 1 \ 2 | Head | Tail |
| :---  | :----: | :---: |
| Head | 1 \ -1 | -1 \ 1 |
| Tail | -1 \ 1 | 1 \ -1 |

No pure Nash Equilibrium.

### Mathematically Define Games

There are n players, {1, 2, ..., n}. Each player has his own set of strategies, Si. User i will choose a strategy, si, from Si. Player i has preference by his payoff (ui) and cost (ci) where

$$u_i: S -> R$$

and

$$c_i: S -> R$$

and actually payoff and cost are interchangeable; that is,

$$u_i(s) = -c_i(s)$$

### Dominant Strategy Solution

A strategy vector

$$s \in S$$

is a dominant strategy solution, if for each player $i$ and each alternative strategy vector

$$s' \in S$$

we have

$$u_i(s_i, s'_{-i}) >= u_i(s'_i, s'_{-i})$$

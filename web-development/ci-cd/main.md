# Title

## Purpose

To detect issues early and provide quicker releases on production.

## Concept

It is a practice of automating building, testing, and deployment.

### building automation

* This step involves automating the process of compiling code, resolving dependencies, and generating executable artifacts or packages.
* Developers commit their code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git), triggering a build process.
* The build process typically involves tasks such as compiling source code, running static code analysis, and creating deployable artifacts.

### testing automation

* Once the build is complete, automated tests are executed against the newly built artifacts to verify their correctness and quality.
* Automated tests can include unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and any other types of tests relevant to the application.
* The goal of testing automation is to ensure that the code changes introduced in the build do not introduce regressions or break existing functionality.

### deployment automation

* After the code changes have been built and tested successfully, the next step is to automate the deployment of the artifacts to various environments, such as development, staging, and production.
* Deployment automation involves tasks such as provisioning infrastructure, configuring servers, deploying application code, and updating databases.
* The ultimate goal of deployment automation is to enable rapid and reliable deployment of changes to production with minimal manual intervention.

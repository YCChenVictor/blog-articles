## Introduction

Load balancers are valuable for network administration and web development as they distribute traffic, enhance performance, and ensure high availability of web applications, achieved through methods like round-robin, least connections, and weighted distribution. An example implementation involves a client making a POST request to the load balancer, which intelligently routes the request to backend servers in a balanced manner, ensuring efficient data storage.

## Why?

Learning about load balancers is valuable for individuals interested in network administration or web development as it equips them with the knowledge and skills to efficiently distribute traffic, enhance system performance, and ensure high availability of web applications.

## How?

* Purpose: Optimize performance, prevent overloading, and ensure high availability of web applications.
* Concept: Evenly distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers
* Example
  * Round-robin: Sequentially assigning each incoming request to the next server in the rotation order, ensuring an equal share of the workload is handled by each server in a cyclic manner.
  * Least connections: Intelligently directs new requests to the server with the fewest active connections, dynamically adjusting the workload allocation based on server load to maintain an equitable distribution and prevent overload.
  * Weighted distribution: Assigning different weights or priorities to each server based on factors such as server capacity, performance, or available resources, allowing more traffic to be directed to servers with higher weights and ensuring an optimal distribution that aligns with the specified weights.

## What?

* Client Side
  * Example
    ```javascript
    // Client makes a POST request
    fetch('/api/data', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ data: 'example data' })
    })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        console.log('Data stored successfully:', data);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error storing data:', error);
      });
    ```
* Server Side
  * Example
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const httpProxy = require('http-proxy');
    const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
    
    // Create an array of backend servers
    const backendServers = [
      { id: uuidv4(), url: 'http://backend-server1:3001' },
      { id: uuidv4(), url: 'http://backend-server2:3002' },
      // Add more backend servers as needed
    ];
    
    // Create a load balancer
    const loadBalancer = httpProxy.createProxyServer();
    
    // Track the index of the last used backend server
    let currentServerIndex = 0;
    
    // POST request handler
    const handlePostRequest = (req, res) => {
      const backendServer = backendServers[currentServerIndex];
      currentServerIndex = (currentServerIndex + 1) % backendServers.length;
    
      // Proxy the request to the selected backend server
      loadBalancer.web(req, res, { target: backendServer.url });
    };

    // POST request handler
    app.post('/api/data', handlePostRequest);
    
    // Create an Express app
    const app = express();
    
    // Apply load balancer middleware
    app.use(handlePostRequest);
    
    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Load balancer server is running on port 3000');
    });
    ```

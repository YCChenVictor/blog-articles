## Behavioral Questions

### Faria

* Give me an example of a time when you had to adapt to a change in a work environment. How did you approach it?

The most pivotal shift in my professional life occurred with the unexpected resignation of the CEO at my previous company, a figure who also happened to be the founder and had held the position for decades. Initially, concerns about potential mass layoffs loomed, causing a sense of apprehension. However, my proactive approach in resolving various issues and introducing valuable features to my product proved instrumental in solidifying my position within the organization.

As my supervisor interviewed me about this abrupt change, I found myself in a tranquil state, buoyed by confidence in the contributions I had made to the team and reassured about the stability of my role. Taking the initiative, I reassured my supervisor that I remained unaffected by the change, despite my initial shock. I emphasized my commitment to maintaining peak performance and ensuring the ongoing success of my role within the organization. This proactive stance not only alleviated any concerns my supervisor may have had but also underscored my dedication to making valuable contributions and retaining a sense of ownership amidst significant organizational changes.

Reflecting on this experience, I've gained a deeper understanding of the importance of dedication in our daily work. Life's uncertainties underscore the need for a consistent and committed approach, as we never know what challenges or opportunities may arise.

* Tell me about a situation where you had to work with a challenging client or customer. How did you handle the relationship?

In my role as a software engineer at Faria, I encountered a challenging situation while working with a particular customer. The challenge revolved around implementing cookie settings for their users visiting their page, utilizing a third-party API that imposed fees based on query volume or multiple domains.

Initially, when we communicated the necessity for the customer to apply for the required credentials due to the associated fees, they were resistant and unwilling to bear the additional cost. This posed a significant hurdle in moving forward with the implementation of the desired features.

To navigate this challenging client relationship, I adopted a proactive and transparent communication approach. I patiently explained the intricacies of the third-party API's fee structure and the reasons why they needed to take charge of obtaining the credentials. I ensured that I provided detailed information on how the fees were essential for accessing the API and, consequently, for delivering the intended cookie settings.

Despite multiple discussions, it took some time for the client to fully comprehend the situation. However, maintaining open lines of communication and emphasizing the importance of these steps for the project's success played a crucial role in building trust. I took the opportunity to showcase the potential benefits and long-term advantages of investing in the necessary credentials, assuring them that it would enhance their users' experience and contribute to the overall success of their platform.

Ultimately, through perseverance and clear communication, the client began to appreciate the need for obtaining the credentials. They acknowledged the rationale behind the decision, and this understanding paved the way for a more cooperative and collaborative working relationship. By the end of the process, not only did we successfully implement the required features, but the experience also highlighted the importance of transparency and effective communication in managing challenging client relationships.

* Describe a situation where you had to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. How did you prioritize and manage your time effectively?

In my daily work at Faria, I often juggled multiple tasks, such as developing new features while addressing urgent bugs. To handle this, I maintained two tickets in progress simultaneously. I did this for three reasons:

1. It prevented me from falling into a 'logic hole.' Sometimes, taking a break and working on another task allowed me to refresh my thinking and find a more creative solution to a problem.
2. It maximized my output by focusing on solving the most significant issue within a given timeframe.
3. It provided a time cushion. If new requirements or edge cases emerged during development, I could adjust my code without the risk of having to redo the entire feature from scratch.

To switch seamlessly between tasks, I took detailed notes while resolving issues.

* Give me an example of a time when you had to take initiative without being prompted. What was the outcome?

The filter system was experiencing performance issues due to the large amount of data it processed. While the system continued to deliver the desired results without any customer complaints, the development team recognized the need for a more efficient solution. However, a complete refactor seemed impractical due to a lack of immediate incentive.

To address this, I proactively decided to study the codebase and create concise documentation for future development. This initiative would benefit the team regardless of whether we decided to refactor the feature or not. Additionally, I proposed a refactor plan that included denormalization, indexing, removing joins, and removing offsets. Although the proposal was not immediately approved due to higher priority features, there is ongoing progress. This approach ensures that in the future, we can seamlessly begin the refactoring process without the need for extensive reevaluation of the codebase.

### Faria, Advancement module

* Can you describe a challenging project you've worked on? Advancement module
* How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure? Transparency

The most challenging one is a module we built in Faria, aiming helping schools, our customers, to manage the relationship with their graduated students. During the development, I need to understand the legacy code in short period because the new feature needs a smooth integration with the old systems. Also, this feature is a premium feature, so I need to modularize it for showing it to only those paid customers.

At first, I asked several co-workers whether they know the logics of the legacy code as there is no unit tests for these features. However, only one developer has developed a similar one with little understanding of these codebase. As a result, I started the try and error process, which literally copy paste the old codebase directly with some amendments and developed one which seemingly fitted the specifications. During the process, I keep full transparency with my manager, product managers, and QA team, resulting in their big supports. For example, the QA team helped me test whether the result achieved the requirements and whether it broke the old features. Moreover, the product manager enhanced my knowledge related to the perspectives from customers and sales team and answered all my questions about the conflicts between old programs and the new business logics. Through out the iterations, I accomplished the new system and it successfully attracts new revenue from customers. Fortunately, I only made one manageable mistake in this whole process, which require some minor amendments on the database data. After this whole process, I am the only person, having full understanding about the fields mechanism in the product, so I also added the key unit tests to keep functionalities.

In the past, I usually expected clear specifications for a new project. Nevertheless, sometime, in a competitive market, benchmarking market has higher priority. Consequently, I need to adjust my mindset to meet the expectations. To have a clear goal, communication serves as a fundamental factor. Then, keep refreshing the goals through adaptability. Then, keep transparency so that team members can help. To boost the efficiency in all aspects during this whole process, honing the coding skill persistently and decomposing the logics into smaller problems to solve step by step are the keys.

### OneAD, SuperDSP

* Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict within a team.
* Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult team member. How did you handle it?

While developing this module, I encountered situations where I required information from other departments. However, my manager prefers all communication to go through her, maintaining a centralized approach to project oversight. Unfortunately, this led to a misunderstanding when one of my co-workers was perceived as attempting to handle tasks covertly. To address this, I engaged in a conversation with my co-worker, emphasizing the importance of aligning our efforts with team goals. I encouraged him to focus on the collective objectives we aimed to achieve and, during our discussion, I also checked if he was experiencing any emotional distress stemming from the miscommunication with our manager. This approach aimed at fostering a positive and collaborative work environment and ensuring that everyone is on the same page moving forward.

### Faria, Parent UI redesign

* Can you share an example of a project or task that didn't go as planned? How did you handle the situation and what did you learn from it?

When I joined the project, the UI had already undergone changes as per the new design; however, both the feature and unit tests were found to be broken. Subsequently, the development team approached the project manager to assign me the task of rectifying the issues. Upon investigation, it became apparent that some desired behaviors had deviated from the correct business logic, and the frontend developers had not strictly adhered to Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, leading to significant delays in the overall processes.

Upon recognizing the need for a more collaborative approach, I adjusted my strategy by informing the project managers first and then engaging closely with the frontend developers to understand the challenges they were facing. This shift initiated a series of productive meetings, where we collectively addressed discrepancies between the design and implemented features, as well as tackled issues within the testing process. Together, we identified root causes, such as miscommunication, a lack of adherence to testing practices, and insufficient communication regarding changes in business requirements. Rather than placing blame on individuals, we focused on improving processes. Collaborating extensively with the frontend developers, I updated the tests to accurately reflect the correct business logic. Simultaneously, we established clearer communication channels among the design, development, and testing teams to prevent similar issues in the future.

### OneAD, Sales Performance

* Describe a moment when you had to lead a team through a challenging project. What strategies did you use to motivate and guide your team?

I did not really have experience to lead a team but I did help my team to walk through some challenges. There are two challenges during the development of a critical feature for this project. The first obstacle was the need for iterative confirmation of results with the sales team, and the second was a knowledge gap among some developers.

To tackle the challenge of confirming results with the sales team, I implemented a communication strategy featuring regular and transparent updates. Recognizing that the sales team manager faced difficulties with the JIRA process, I adapted by providing consistent updates in a Google document tailored for her easy review and understanding.

To address the knowledge gap, I organized targeted training sessions, empowering team members with the skills such as rails code needed for specific features. Additionally, I fostered collaboration through pair programming, facilitating the transfer of expertise and fostering a sense of teamwork within the group.

Throughout the entire process, I consistently emphasized the benefits of the new feature, effectively boosting my co-workers' motivation and willingness to contribute their efforts. This approach ensured that the team remained aligned with the project goals and understood the significance of their contributions.

### Faria, Admission Journey

* Can you share a situation where you had to make a tough decision? How did you come to the conclusion, and what were the results?

During the development of this feature, a pivotal decision arose regarding whether to adhere to the existing field design or to embrace a new CRUD approach. Opting for continuity with the old design necessitates the creation of a syncing mechanism for the fields. On the other hand, adopting the new CRUD approach allows for direct querying of required data from another table. However, this requires the addition of a new field in the field system merely to serve as a link between the new feature and the field feature.

While the latter option streamlines data retrieval, it introduces the risk of confusion in future developments. The new field essentially functions as a connection point, lacking any further utility within the context of field features. This trade-off prompts consideration of the long-term implications for clarity and maintainability in the evolving system.

Initially, I contemplated incorporating historical tracking features, leaning towards the more conservative option of sticking with the existing field system. However, upon closer examination, it became evident that this approach did not yield any substantial benefits. As I delved into the intricacies of the field system, I identified a potential requirement for import and export capabilities for the field.

To ensure alignment with project goals, I consulted with the project manager about the necessity of these additional implementations. The PM clarified that such features were not required for the current project. Consequently, I made the strategic decision to forego the field system and instead opted for the implementation of the new feature using a CRUD approach. This choice was driven by a pragmatic evaluation of the specific needs and priorities of the project at hand.

### Demo Site

* Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership skills. What was the outcome of your actions?

When I was at Faria, I took full responsibility for maintaining demo sites, which required annual updates to meet sales demonstration needs. Throughout this process, I collaborated closely with my manager, the sales team, the product manager, and the QA team to gather key information. To improve communication efficiency, we needed a reliable method for sharing information.

The product manager had already implemented a Google document for the sales team to list all the requirements. However, translating these requirements into code and data required more detailed scenarios, such as edge cases and the specific data we wanted to share with customers. This level of detail was challenging for the sales team and product manager to determine in advance.

To address this, I initiated a meeting with my manager and proposed building the demo site to meet all requirements quickly. I then planned to assist the QA team with a rapid check on one demo site. Afterward, I would ask the product manager to review the results, as they had domain knowledge about customer preferences.

I viewed this approach as similar to a greedy algorithm, where I carefully managed my time to prioritize solving issues with the greatest impact, rather than spending too much time on minor issues. Finally, I requested quick feedback from the sales team to ensure the demo sites met their needs effectively.

The main outcome of these iterative process is successfully updating all the demo sites without errors before the deadline.

### New Skills

* Describe a situation in which you had to learn a new skill or technology quickly. How did you go about it?

In my role as a software engineer at OneAD, I encountered a situation where I had to rapidly acquire knowledge of Vue.js and understand the principles of frontend-backend separation. Similarly, while working at Faria, I needed to quickly familiarize myself with various design patterns to develop scalable systems.

In such scenarios, my approach remains consistent. Firstly, I thoroughly examine the existing codebase to identify any patterns or features that may be analogous to the new skill or technology required. Consulting with team members helps expedite this process, as their insights can provide valuable shortcuts.

If no relevant information is found internally, I turn to online resources. The internet is a treasure trove of similar functionalities and solutions. By leveraging available documentation and tutorials, I can swiftly build a foundational understanding and begin implementing the necessary features or addressing issues.

Throughout the development process, I prioritize test-driven development. Building tests first not only ensures the correctness of the current implementation but also facilitates future modifications for maintainability and readability.

After completing an initial version of the code, I proactively communicate with my manager. I make them aware of the situation, explaining that the feature was developed from scratch. This transparency is crucial in managing expectations, and I may request additional time or resources to refine the code further.

Furthermore, I arrange a meeting with the feature requesters to validate the results and gather any specific requirements for quality assurance testing. Clear communication at this stage helps in refining the solution and ensuring alignment with stakeholders' expectations.

### Database

#### Past Challenges, advancement module

In my past experience, I encountered a particularly challenging situation revolving around the maintenance of fundamental data within our application. While Rails' migration mechanism streamlined schema management, ensuring stability, the creation and management of core application data posed significant hurdles.

Within a newly developed module, I was tasked with crafting scripts to generate essential foundational data. These scripts were subject to frequent modifications, mirroring shifts in our PM's marketing strategies. Consequently, meticulous attention to detail was paramount, as any amendments had to be carefully implemented to avoid disrupting the application's functionality.

Furthermore, to safeguard against data contamination, I devised temporary mechanisms to segregate test user data from other user records within the database. This measure ensured that newly generated data remained isolated during testing phases, preventing unintended consequences on existing datasets.

While scripts could be rewritten to accommodate changes in staging environments, adjustments to the production database demanded a more cautious approach. With shifts in business logic, mere script creation proved insufficient. Instead, comprehensive modifications were necessary, considering the broader implications of introducing or modifying foundational data.

Navigating these challenges required a delicate balance between flexibility and precision, as any missteps could potentially disrupt the integrity of our production environment.

#### How to deal with price in database?

* Data Type Selection: Use an appropriate data type for storing prices, such as DECIMAL or NUMERIC, which are precise and suitable for monetary values. Avoid using floating-point data types like FLOAT or DOUBLE, as they can introduce rounding errors due to their limited precision.
  * Floating-point data types like FLOAT or DOUBLE use binary representation, which can introduce rounding errors when representing decimal fractions.
* Normalization: Store price-related information in a normalized manner. It's common to have a separate table for prices, especially if prices can vary over time or depend on other factors. This can help maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy.
* Currency Handling: If dealing with multiple currencies, consider storing prices in a base currency and including a separate column for the currency code. Alternatively, you may choose to store prices in a single currency and perform currency conversions as needed.
* Handling Discounts and Taxes: Determine how to handle discounts, taxes, and other price adjustments. It's often useful to store these as separate fields or in separate tables to accurately calculate the final price.
* Precision and Rounding: Be mindful of precision and rounding rules to ensure accurate calculations. For example, round prices to an appropriate number of decimal places to avoid displaying excessive precision to users.
* Consistency: Enforce consistency in price formatting and handling across the database to avoid confusion and errors. Use validation rules or constraints to ensure that prices adhere to the specified format and range.
* Auditing and History: Maintain a history of price changes if necessary, especially for products or services with fluctuating prices over time. This can be achieved by adding timestamp columns or using a separate table to track price revisions.
* Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect price-related data from unauthorized access or manipulation. Ensure that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to modify prices.

##### Example, USD to TWD

Let's say we need to store the exchange rate information in a table where USD to TWD now is 32.08, then we can create a table in mysql as follow:

```mysql
CREATE TABLE currency_exchange (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    currency_from VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    currency_to VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    exchange_rate DECIMAL(10, 5) NOT NULL -- Adjust precision and scale as needed
);
```

* DECIMAL(10, 5) means precision of 10 and a scale of 5
  * The total number of digits allowed, including both sides of the decimal point, is 10.
  * Out of these 10 digits, 5 are allocated to the right side of the decimal point (scale), and the remaining 5 digits can be used for the integer part (precision - scale).

## Resume

### Faria

* Why transfer from Economics to Software? During my academic pursuits and professional endeavors in economics, I gained significant experience in programming. For instance, I developed applications using R programming and leveraged TensorFlow for stock price prediction. Additionally, during my tenure as an analyst at Taiwan Mobile, I automated numerous reports using VBA code.
* How do you know the number of users? Through the news report of the CEO in the past.
* How do you know you refactored 15 modules? Through my notes of all the refactors. We had weekly sessions to discuss the code quality.
* How do you calculate the percentage of test coverage? It's a approximation, I know my total number of PRs and I know the total number of PRs in the period.
* How do you know the number of daily logins is 100K? Number of user (4 millions), 30 days expiration dates -> Users will login 12 times a year -> 4 millions * 12 / 365 = 100,000
* How do you reduce the filter time? How did you calculate 66% reduces? There are offset, joins, N+1 in that query -> Solve N+1 first, try to reduce unnecessary joins, and add indexing to heavy large table to improve offset.
* How do you know you refined the public API processing? Some fields need to do pre-calculation but it is actually heavy read, so I add these fields to the cache, then we do not need to re-calculate them again. Also, some user will not receive updated fields value because of cache, so I proposed a new service to do correct re-caches after data changes. Combined, the waiting time of the API decreased 50%.
* External APIs such as zendesk, LOU, Canny are all to help users. As a result, users can make good use of all those features in all the webpages.
* External APIs such as Google Tag and Cookie can help internal teams to analyze the user behaviors, which can significantly boost the future design.
* To boost the maintainability, I do write notes during my daily work. Also, if the features are important, I will write professional articles on work shared documents.
* The number of users increase 3% within one month, so we think the revenue can increase for 36%

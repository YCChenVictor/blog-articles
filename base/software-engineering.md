# Software Engineering

## Purpose

To help me build good software. Several articles are still in progress.

## Concept

### Applications & Advanced Topics

For this section, I believe building something would be more helpful.

* Frontend: I use react to write blog and worked in Vue too
* Backend: I worked in rails and express
* AI / ML: I used tensorflow modeling for my bittensor project.
* Cybersecurity
* Blockchain: I am not building a DAO in solidity. Also, I have experience in bittensor.

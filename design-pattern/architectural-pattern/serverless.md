### Serverless Architectures

Represents a paradigm where applications are built using serverless functions and cloud services, often challenging traditional categorizations.

#### Examples

AWS Lambda: The primary compute service for serverless functions on Amazon Web Services. Serverless Framework simplifies the deployment and management of AWS Lambda functions.

Amazon API Gateway: Enables the creation, deployment, and management of RESTful APIs. Serverless Framework integrates with API Gateway to expose HTTP endpoints for serverless functions.

Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service. Serverless applications often use DynamoDB for data storage, and the framework can automate the provisioning of DynamoDB tables.

Amazon S3: A scalable object storage service. Serverless applications may use S3 for storing and retrieving data, and the framework can configure events to trigger functions based on S3 events.

Amazon SQS and SNS: Simple Queue Service (SQS) for message queuing and Simple Notification Service (SNS) for pub/sub messaging. Serverless Framework supports integrating with SQS and SNS to handle asynchronous messaging in serverless applications.

Amazon EventBridge: A serverless event bus service. Serverless Framework can be used to configure functions to respond to events from EventBridge, enabling event-driven architectures.

Azure Functions: Microsoft Azure's serverless compute service. Serverless Framework supports deploying and managing functions on Azure, extending its multi-cloud capabilities.

Google Cloud Functions: Google Cloud's serverless compute service. Serverless Framework supports deploying and managing functions on Google Cloud, providing another option for multi-cloud deployments.

Auth0: An identity and access management service. Serverless Framework can be configured to handle authentication and authorization using Auth0 in serverless applications.

Twilio: A cloud communications platform. Serverless Framework can integrate with Twilio for handling SMS, voice, and other communication functionalities in serverless applications.

Datadog, New Relic, and other Monitoring Services: Serverless Framework supports integrations with various monitoring and logging services to help developers monitor the performance and health of serverless applications.

## Introduction

(TBC)

## Why

We need mailer in Rails to efficiently send emails, such as welcome messages, notifications, password resets, and other important communications, to users and stakeholders.

## How

### Configuration

Configure the SMTP settings for email provider. For example, to use [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), we can add the following configuration:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do  
  ...
  # add the following SMTP setup  
  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp  
  config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {  
    address: 'smtp.mailgun.org',  
    port: 587,  
    domain: 'any_domain_name',  
    user_name: 'user_name_from_mailgun',  
    password: 'password_from_mailgun',  
    authentication: 'plain',  
    enable_starttls_auto: true  
  }  
end
```

in `config/environments/development.rb`.

### Generate Mailer

In rails project, generate mailer with
```
$ rails g mailer Contact
```
and then rails will create following files: (The concept of mailer is similar to controller and view)

* `app/mailers/application_mailer.rb`
  ```ruby
  class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base  
    default from: 'from@example.com'
    layout 'mailer'  
  end
  ```
  * `default from: 'from@example.com'` means by default, the mail will be sent by from@example.com
  * `layout 'mailer'` means by default, it will find the template, `mailer.html.erb`
* `contact_mailer.rb`
  ```ruby
  class ContactMailer < ApplicationMailer  
  end
  ```
  * Just like how controller connect to views, the method name in mailer is by default the same as the html file name; for example, we create following method in `contact_mailer.rb`
    ```ruby
    class ContactMailer < ApplicationMailer  
      def say_hello_to(user)  
        @user = user  
        mail to: @user.email, subject:"Hello!!"  
      end  
    end
    ```
    * The method will try to find `say_hello_to.html.erb` in `views/contact_mailer`
* `app/views/layouts/mailer.html.erb`
* `mailer.text.erb`
* `app/views/contact_mailer`
  * We create `views/contact_mailer/say_hello_to.html.erb` with
    ```ruby
    <%= @user.name %>,Hello:
    Have a nice day!~
    ```
    * The text in this file will be the context of the email that the system is going to send

### Send Mail

For example, If we want to send mail every time we create a user, we should add the following in the method, `create` of user controller

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController  
  ...

  def create  
    @user = User.new(user_params)  
    if @user.save  
      ContactMailer.say_hello_to(@user).deliver_now  
      redirect_to @user, notice: 'User was successfully created.'  
    else  
      render :new  
    end  
  end
  ...
end
```

`ConcactMailer.say_hello_to(@user).deliver_now` means it call the method to send say hello after creating user and the mail is the input mail in user creating method.

### Result

Then we can test the effects on [mailgun dashboard](https://support.cloudways.com/configure-mailgun-smtp/). <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/1__tjoMode96kMVQdhLZlhYXA.png" alt=""> For more information related to smtp, please refer to [smtp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol).

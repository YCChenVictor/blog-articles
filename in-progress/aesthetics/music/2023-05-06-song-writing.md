## Introduction

Song = lyrics + melodies.

## Why?

Songs can express my feelings in a safe way.

## How

### General Ideas

* Produce a fix amount of music on the daily basis (do not trust inspiration)
* Do not relay on instruments, please sing out your mind by thinking the feelings and record it
* Do not repeat a melody above three time
* Read literature as much as possible
* Remember to add some space (silent is a part of music)

### Steps

* Melodies
  * Live life and feel it and then compose the melodies while thinking about them (you can compose an article first)
  * Get inspirations past music, movie, and literature and also practice compositions from others
  * Drop down melodies for verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge
    * Record it directly with phone
    * Compose music sheet with music app to find the chords
    * Record it with record audio
  * Arrange bass line for the melodies
  * Arrange chords based on the melodies (the composition of the chords should be the notes in the measure)
* Lyrics
  * Find a past moment that I truly want to express
  * Compose a story to wrap the moment
  * Drop down the lyrics
  * Get feedback from people and teacher

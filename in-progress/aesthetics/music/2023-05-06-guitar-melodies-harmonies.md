## Why?

This article is to understand the characteristics of guitar sounds and help me write songs with them.

## How?

* Chord Voicings
  * Concept: The guitar's six-string layout and multiple frets empower players to shape diverse chord voicings and inversions, enabling creative exploration of harmonies, chord progressions, and the incorporation of techniques like fingerpicking or hybrid picking for added complexity in chordal arrangements.
  * Example:
    * Master Basic Chord Shapes: Start by learning essential open chords and barre chords, which will lay the foundation for understanding chord composition. Practice transitioning between different chord shapes to develop finger dexterity and familiarity with the fretboard.
    * Understand Chord Theory
      * Intervals
        * Construct the chords progression with modal vamps; for example, III -> VI -> II -> V -> I progression of D dorian (Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, C) would be Fmaj7 -> Bdim -> Em7 -> Am7 -> Dm9 and it sounds like (I need tools to records the sound)
        * Use the constructed foundation and write melodies on it
        * Document them
        * Modal vamps means chords progression such as II IV I in modes
          ```test
          C maj:
          
          C dorian:
          
          C 
          ```
          * half step matters
          * try to write songs with mode and melodies on it
          * Two ways of thinking about modes
            * derivative: D dorian is C major starting on the second degree
            * parallel: D dorina is D major with b3 and b7 (better choice)
      * chord construction
      * chord progressions

### Analyze and Learn from Songs

Analyze songs and chord progressions from various genres to gain insights into chord composition. By studying the chords used and their functions within the progressions, you can expand your chord vocabulary and incorporate new ideas into your own compositions.



* Timbre
  * Concept: The guitar produces a rich and resonant sound that is characterized by its unique timbre. Depending on factors such as the type of guitar (acoustic, electric, classical), the construction, the materials used, and the player's technique, the guitar can have a warm, mellow, bright, percussive, or even aggressive tone. This variety of tonal possibilities allows guitarists to explore different sonic landscapes and evoke specific emotions.
* Sustain and Decay
  * Concept: The guitar has the ability to sustain notes for an extended period, allowing the player to create long, expressive melodies. This sustain, combined with the guitar's natural decay, adds a sense of depth and resonance to the music. It enables guitarists to create intricate melodies and harmonies that weave together, providing a rich tapestry of sound.

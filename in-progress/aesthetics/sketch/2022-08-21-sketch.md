## Why?

Sketches are essential because they allow us to quickly and visually communicate ideas, explore different possibilities, and plan out compositions before diving into more detailed and finalized artwork.

## How?

Steps:
* Define the problem or idea
  * Purpose: Provide clarity and direction to creative process, ensuring that our sketch effectively addresses the intended objective or conveys the desired concept.
  * Concept: Before starting a sketch, it is crucial to define the purpose, problem, or idea you aim to address, establish project scope and constraints, and gather relevant information or research to inform your sketching process.
  * Example: What's love?
* Gather your materials
  * Purpose: The purpose of gathering your materials is to ensure that you have the necessary tools and resources to create your sketch, allowing you to effectively express your artistic vision and bring your ideas to life.
  * Concept: To create your sketch, it is important to have the appropriate materials based on your preferred medium, ranging from traditional pen and paper to digital drawing software and a tablet, ensuring you have the necessary tools for your artistic expression.
  * Example: Pencil
* Rough out the basic shapes and layout
  * Purpose: Begin by loosely sketching the fundamental shapes and layout of your concept, using basic lines and circles to represent the main elements, without striving for perfection at this stage; the primary objective is to capture your ideas on paper, allowing for refinement in the subsequent stages.
* Refine your sketch
  * Purpose: After establishing the basic layout, enhance your sketch by incorporating additional details and nuances, focusing on proportions, shading, and other elements that enhance realism and visual appeal to refine your design.
* Iterate and revise
  * Purpose: Sketching is an iterative process, which means you'll likely need to revise and refine your ideas multiple times before you arrive at a final design. Take feedback from others and consider how you can improve your sketch over time.
* Finalize your sketch
  * Purpose: Once you're happy with your sketch, it's time to finalize it. This could involve transferring it to a more permanent medium, such as canvas or digital file, or adding finishing touches to bring it to life.

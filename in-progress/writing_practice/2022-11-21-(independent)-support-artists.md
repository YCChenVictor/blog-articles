Should the government support artist or should the artists support themselves?

---

People often possess different perspective on whether government should support artists or not. As for me, I strongly argue that the government should not support artists.

First of all, the government cares about budget and supporting artists will cost government lots of money. For example, when the government decides to give each artist 10 thousand NT Dollars each month, it cost for total 1 million NT Dollars. However, the artists can still produce no valuable arts, which will not worth more than 1 million NT Dollars a month on average. As a result, supporting artists is an irrational investment. On the other hand, if the artists support themselves, the government would not need to pay any cost. Moreover, those untalented artists will be selected out from market so that government can make sure only qualified artists in the country. Apparently, on the aspect of budget, not supporting artists can give better result for the government.

Secondly, the government usually focuses on votes and supporting artist may lose more votes. To be more specific, artists are the minority and the government can put more emphasis on welfare of majority, which can gain more votes with same effort. On the contrary, if the artists support themselves, the government will lose only artists' votes. Moreover, this policy are still under consideration, meaning the artists will not notice the government refuses to support them and keep voting ruling party. Therefore, on the aspect of votes, the government should not support the artists.

Last but not least, the government often whishes to gain better international relationship and supporting artists has little help towards better relationship. Instead of supporting any foreign or domestic artists with one billion NT Dollars per year, we should invest more important industries such as semiconductor, computer science, and health care for better economic status. With better status, when there are conflicts between countries, we can have more power to negotiate with other countries or even help other them. Clearly, putting too much efforts on artists makes no sense.

In conclusion, the government obviously should not support artists. After all, it seeks to control budget, have more votes, and gain better international relationships.

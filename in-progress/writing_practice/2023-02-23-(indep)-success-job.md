For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school.

---

People often have different perspective on whether we should have more connection on people or spend more time on study. In my humble opinion, I prefer studying hard in school in three aspects, professions, critical thinking, and ability to learn.

Firstly, we must need a profession to get into a job. As a result, we must study hard to get the required knowledges to the particular job we want. To be more specific, I am a softare engineer and it is not possible to write software with technical knowledge.

Secondly, to solve business problems, we need the ability to think critically. That is to say, we need to systematically decompose a problem that we never meet before. To achieve this ability, we must need a certain level of training to our brain, meaning studying hard is essential.

Thirdly, if we want to bring advancement in current business environment, the ability to implement advanced technologies to our job plays critical part. For example, if there is a routinely job, we can write a software to automatize it, which means we need to learn how to use these tools at least. Studying hard in school trains us to have the required ability to learn them.

In conclusion, I believe we need to study hard in school to success in a future job because we need to hone our ability to solve unfamiliar problems in the future. After all, we have plenty of time to learn how to interact with colleagues but we only have one chance to train our brain when we are in school.

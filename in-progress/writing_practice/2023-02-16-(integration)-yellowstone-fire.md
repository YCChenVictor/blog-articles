Yellowstone fire

---

Both the article and the speaker tell about the impacts of natural forest fires in Yellowstone. The article critizes the let it burn policy towards the fires on three perspectives, vegetation, wild animal, and local economy; however, the speaker rejects the idea with following reasons.

Firstly, the lecturer argues that fire will actually increase the diversity of vegetation. For example, the fire will cause damage to larger trees but also give chances to smaller planets to grow. Also, the existed seeds specifically grow with higher temperature can also appear after the fires.

Secondly, the speaker gives example based on smaller planets furtherly. She argues that smaller animals will survives by consuming smaller planets, which can develop new food chain.

Thirdly, the professor thinks the fires are rare by saying that the probability of the reasons to cause fires are low. As a result, she proposes that the tourists actually come back after the fires and the number of tourists increases year by year.

In conclusion, the reading material rejects the idea of let it burn in Yellowstone with damages to vegetation, wild animal and local economy. Nevertheless, the speaker gives examples and reasonings to each of them and thinks the policy is correct.

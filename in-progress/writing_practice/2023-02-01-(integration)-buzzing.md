Buzzing

---

Both the article and the student talked about buzzing in commercial advertisement. While the article has several critics about buzzing, the students give counter examples to fight back.

Firstly, he take himself as example. When he get hired by a company to be a buzzer. He thought the products are really good and really want to recommend them to consumers. As a result, he thinks what the article mentioned on first point that people have more motive for misleading when they get paid is wrong.

Secondly, the passage argues that buzzers pretending private individuals let consumers believe them more. Again, the student rejects the idea by his own experience. He found that not everyone believe what he said when he was a buzzer. Furthermore, people only believe him when he can give good reason for their questions about the product.

Thirdly, the reading material describes that buzzer can have negative impact to social relationship. However, the student give another reasoning to decline this idea. That is, if a product is good, then the company can hire good buzzer and give better information to society, which is good to social relationship.

In conclusion, the student give three ideas to support the buzzing strategy in commercial advertisements. The article may need more concise evidences to support its own idea.

Library exist or not

---

People often have different opinions towards whether library will disappear because of the development of technology. In my opinion, the library will not disappear in the future.

Firstly, I am a person needing environment to study and I actually like to learn search knowledge on internet in library. For example, as a software engineer, I build a blog to record my daily readings with code in library. Although I actually do not borrow books from library, I still like to work on blogs in library.

Secondly, as a student with master degree, I do know that the authors of studies can choose whether to offer their articles on the internet. That is, the readers may not have the opportunity to read these materials on the internet and they must go to the library in universities to obtain required knowledge.

Finally, library can serve as a place for people gathering because not all knowledge acquiring events can be hold on the internet. To be more specific, during the pandemic, I had tried to join study group on the internet but it is quite difficult to have deeper conversation because of unstable wifi. But if we can meeting in the library, we there will not be a problem.

Given that I am a person needing environment to study, I do not want to share my study article on internet and I had faced problem related to internet issues during meetings, I think library will not disappear. That is to say, there are always some people like me, who needs libraries.

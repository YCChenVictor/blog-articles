Summarize the reading and lecture about archaeologist in Britain

---

Both the reading and lecture discuss the situation of archaeologists in Britain. The reading implies that archaeologists faces serious problems and limitations in Britain. However, the professor strongly disagrees with this passage.

First of all, the reading passage mentions that the constructions destroy the artifacts, so there is no researching materials for archaeologists. Yet, the lecturer severely challenges the theory by arguing that a law enforces that all constructions needs to be examined by archaeologists before any progress, which can preserve the artifacts around the construction area. (字數不夠可以把它再拆成更 detail 的)

Secondly, the passage suggests that archaeologists feel the financial support for archaeological research is inadequate. Nevertheless, the scholar seriously contradicts this suggestions because the law also asks construction company to pay for archaeologists' examinations. To elaborate, with the law, archeologists can not only get financial add from construction companies but also research more artifacts before the constructions begins.

Last but not least, the reading indicates that it is difficult to have a career in archaeology. Once again, the speaker opposes the evidences revealed in the reading passage by the law. To be more specific, because construction needs to hire archaeologists to preserve artifacts before any progress, the market demands of archeologists is increases. Apparently, the aspect of this paragraph is not correct.

In conclusion, the professor argues against each theory in the reading. That is, he maintains that archaeologists face no serious problems and limitations in Britain.

The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide (agree/disagree)

---

People often posses different perspectives on the best way to travel. As for me, I strongly argue that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide.

First of all, I am an introvert and traveling in a group consumes me too much energy. For example, when I travel to Taichung with my friends, I spent nearly whole day dealing with the relationships with them. Moreover, I also consume physical energy to enjoy the trip. As a result, I feel really tired after both the intense mental and physical consumption. On the other hand, if I can travel alone just like what I do in Taipei, I would only feel tired physically. Apparently, as an introvert, traveling alone gives me better status.

Secondly, I am a man full of curiosity and traveling alone lets me do whatever I want to explore. For instance, when I travel alone to Tainan, I spent nearly whole trip to explore different flavor of beef soup. Accordingly, this trip may not be acceptable for other people in the group but I have a great time. On the contrary, if I travel in a group, I must need to follow the decision made by others and cannot have the opportunities to fullfil my curiosity. Therefore, to satisfy myself, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not an option.

Last but not least, I care about quality and I need to take others' budget into consideration in a group. Take my journey to Germany as example. When I travel, I want comfortable seats, so I take business class both on the flight and high speed rails. Furthermore, I also live the best hotel in that country. However, if I choose to travel with others, I must need to care about others' money and feelings. Thus, I will lose high standard quality on my trip and feel worse.

In conclusion, I disagree the statement and recommend all people should travel on their own. After all, as an introvert who is curious about anything and want a high quality trip, traveling in a group would be a nightmare for me.

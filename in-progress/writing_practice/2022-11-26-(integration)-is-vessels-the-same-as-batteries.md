Summarize the reading and lecture about the vessel

---

Both the reading and the lecture discuss whether the vessels, clay jay contained a copper cylinder surrounding an iron rod, were used as batteries in ancient times. The reading implies that the vessels were not used as batteries. However, the professor strongly disagrees with the reading passage.

First of all, the reading passage mentions that no metal wires were attached to the vessels. Yet, the lecturer severely challenges the theory by arguing that the local people are not geologist. To elaborate, she states that they may not recognize the metal wires. Therefore, they may overlook the proof.

Secondly, the passage suggests that the copper cylinder were used for holding scrolls of scared texts. Nevertheless, the scholar seriously contradicts the hypothesis because the copper cylinders later discovered with water can produce electricity. As a result, the copper can later be used for other reason, not just for holding scrolls.

Last but not least, the reading indicates that no devices can reply on electricity in ancient time. Once again, the speaker opposes the evidence revealed in the passage because evidences showed that there are some invisible power in ancient times. To elaborate, the electricity may be used for healing or showing magic powers. Apparently, it may still be useful in ancient time even without devices.

In conclusion, the professor argues against each theory in the reading. That is to say, he maintains that the vessels are batteries in ancient times.

Some prefer to decorate their room, study room or other places. Some keep it simple. Which do you prefer and why?

---

People possess different perspectives on whether to decorate their room. As for me, I do not decorate my room at all.

Firstly, I am an outgoing person. As a result, I often go out with my friends on my leisure time. That is, my room is only for me to sleep. To be more specific, I always stay outside my house from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m, so I really do not gain any energy in my personal room.

Secondly, I am a poor person and decorate my room will cost me too much money. For example, I know my room is really boring and should not just have only one bed and one table, meaning I should have some budgets to buy something new to decorate it. However, the reality do not allow me to do it. Accordingly, I prefer to keep it simple.

Finally, I really enjoy my focusing time to accomplish tasks smoothly and too many unnecessary things in my room must distract me. For instance, when I only have a table, I only need to clean this table and then I can start my work. Nevertheless, if I have too many decorations on my desk, I will need to reorganized them first, which take time and makes me inefficient.

In conclusion, I will keep my room as simple as possible. After all, I am an outgoing person, trying to save more money and be more efficient on my work.

## Introduction

quick explanation

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

* Sweating: Sweat glands produce sweat composed of water and electrolytes that evaporate on the skin surface, taking heat away from the body and cooling the skin. The hypothalamus senses temperature changes and signals the sweat glands via the sympathetic nervous system to produce sweat, which is known as thermoregulatory sweating and regulates body temperature by dissipating heat.
      * Shivering: The hypothalamus sends signals to muscles to generate heat through rapid muscle contractions and activates the sympathetic nervous system to release adrenaline, which increases metabolic rate and stimulates muscle activity, helping to raise body temperature and maintain a stable internal environment. This process requires the breakdown of glucose and the release of energy in the form of heat.
      * Changes in blood flow: Blood vessels in the skin constrict or dilate to regulate blood flow and help regulate body temperature through radiation and convection. The sympathetic nervous system regulates this process by releasing noradrenaline to dilate blood vessels in response to rising temperatures and constrict them when temperatures drop, retaining heat.

## Introduction

(to be continued)

## Why?

We need to learn about atoms, molecules, and ions because they form the fundamental building blocks of matter and understanding their properties and interactions is crucial for understanding the behavior of the physical world around us.

## How?

### fundamental laws

There are three laws:

* Conservation of mass: The total mass of the reactants in a chemical reaction is always equal to the total mass of the products, and mass cannot be created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, only rearranged.
* Definite proportion: chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio
  * example: $$CO_2$$ has one C (6) and two O (8), so in X grams of $$CO_2$$, there must be X * 6/(6+8*2) grams of O and X * 8*2/(6+8*2) grams of O. The proportion of C/O must be 3/8.
* Multiple proportions: given two elements form more than one compound, the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will always be ratios of small whole numbers
  * example: in $$CO$$ and $$CO_2$$, given one mass of C, the ratio of O in CO and $$CO_2$$ must be $$1/2$$

### Dalton’s atomic theory

* All matter is made of atoms
* All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties
* Chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine
* Atoms are not changed in chemical reactions but the way they are bound together
changes

### Early atomic experiments and models

* Thomson model
  * contribution: discovery of electron and nucleus
  * details: TBC
* Millikan experiment
  * contribution: charge of a single electron to be -1.602 × 10−19 coulomb and showed that all charges were multiples of this number
  * details: TBC
* Rutherford experiment
  * contribution: most of the atom is empty space surrounding a tiny nucleus
  * details: TBC

### Atomic structure

* nucleus contains protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge)
* electrons reside outside the nucleus
  * electrons, negative charge, small mass (1/1840 of proton)
  * the distance between electrons and nucleus is relatively large
* isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers

### bonds

Atoms combine to form molecules by sharing electrons to form bonds such as iconic and covalent.

* Structural formula
  * definition: demonstrates molecules with bonds and atoms on 2D
  * example: TBC (can draw $$H_2O$$ here)
* Ball-and-stick model
  * definition: demonstrates molecules with bonds (stick) and atoms (ball) on 3D
  * example: TBC
* Space-filling model
  * deifiition: demonstrates molecules with overlapping spheres to show the bonds on 3D
  * example: TBC

### Ions

Ion's total number of electrons is unequal to total number of protons, meaning the new charge of it is not zero.

* Cation
  * formed by loss of an electron, positive charge
  * metals
* Anion
  * formed by gain of an electron, negative charge
  * Nonmetals
* Ionic bonds: formed by interaction of cations and anions

### compound

* binary compounds: chemical compounds comprising of **two** distinct elements
  * binary ionic compounds, type I
    * definition: contain a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion)
    * example: NaCl
  * binary ionic compounds, type II
    * definition: more than one type of positive ion -> more than one type of ionic compound
    * example: $$FeCl_2$$ and $$FeCl_3$$
  * binary covalent compounds, type III
    * definition: formed between two nonmetals
    * example: $$H_2O$$
* non binary compounds: compounds that contain **more than two** different elements
  * example: $$NaOH$$
  * $$OH^-$$ is a kind of polyatomic ion

### Ions vs molecules

* Ion are compound with ionic bond and molecule are compound with covalent bond
* quickest way to predict the bond: `metal + nonmetal = ionic` and `nonmetal + nonmetal = covalent`
* covalent bond forms by sharing electrons
* ionic bond forms by transfering electrons

### molecules vs compound

When atoms bonds together, it forms molecule. When two different atoms bonds together, it forms compound; actually, compound is a kind of molecules but the atoms must be different. For example, $$H_2O$$ is both molecule and compound but $$O_2$$ is only molecule.

Binary compounds
• Type I—contain a metal that always forms the same cation
• Type II—contain a metal that can form more than one cation • Type III—contain two nonmetals
􏳂 Compounds containing a polyatomic ion

### periodic table

* periodic table organizes elements in order of increasing atomic number
  * atomic number: the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
* elements with similar properties are in columns, or groups
  * because the arrangement of electrons in outermost layer are the same
  * example: O is $$1s^22s^22p^4$$, S is $$1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^4$$, and Se is $$3d^{10}4s^24p^4$$

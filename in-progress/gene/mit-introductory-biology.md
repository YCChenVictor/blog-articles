Textbook 2.2

* covalent bonds -> sharing electrons -> strongest -> e.g. $H_2$
  * The atoms can rotate -> make up living tissues
  * single bond, $H-H$
  * double bond, $C=C$
  * triple bond, $Nâ‰¡N$
  * electronegativity, the attractive force that an atomic nucleus exerts on electrons
    * The closer the electrons, the greater
    * The more positive charges, the greater
    * Two atoms with close electronegativity -> nonpolar covalent bond
    * Two atoms with different electronegativity -> polar covalent bond
* ionic attractions -> achieve stability through gain or lose electrons
  * Significantly different electronegativity
  * Na + Cl -> $NA^+ + Cl^-$
  * Positively charged ions are cations
  * Negatively charged ions are anions
  * Groups of covalently bounded atoms with electric charge are complex ions; e.g. $NH_4^+$
  * $NaCl$ -> into water -> $Na^+$ attracts the $\delta^-$ pole of water and $Cl^+-$ attracts the $\delta^+$ -> water polarity, a good biological solvent
* hydrogen bonds -> weaker interaction
  * Resulted from $\delta^-$ and $\delta^+$
  * Hydrogen bonding between water -> important fro living system
  * Hydrogen bonds play important roles in determining and maintaining the three-dimensional shapes of giant molecules such as DNA and proteins
  * hydrophobic -> water-hating -> nonpolar molecules are more attracted to one another than to water
  * hydrophilic -> water-loving -> molecules with polar covalent bounds are attracted to polar water
* van der Waals forces
  * When two molecules are in close proximity

Text 3.1

* proteins
  * polymers, constructed by covalent bonding of monomers, smaller molecules
  * formed from different combinations of 20 amino acids, all of which share chemical similarities
* carbohydrates
  * polymers, constructed by covalent bonding of monomers, smaller molecules
  * can form giant molecules by linking together chemically similar sugar monomers to form polysaccharides
* nucleic acids
  * polymers, constructed by covalent bonding of monomers, smaller molecules
  * formed from four kinds of nucleotide monomers linked together in long chains
* lipids
  * noncovalent forces maintain the interactions between the lipid monomers
  * Also form large structures from a limited set of smaller molecules
* Polyer with molecular weights > 1000 -> macromolecules -> proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids
* Optical isomers
  * When carbon atom has four different atoms or groups of atoms attached to it
* The function of macromolecules are directly related to their three-dimensional shapes
  * Only nucleic acids specialize in information storage and transmission
  * most macromolecules are formed by condensation and broken down by hydrolysis

Read text: 8.1, 8.3 - 8.5 (read the summary first, the summary is in the end of the chapter)

textbook 8.1

* The usable energy is free energy; The unusable energy is entropy
  * $H = G + TS$ (total energy = usable energy + unusable energy, T is absolute temperature and S is entropy)
  * $\triangle G_{reaction} = G_{product} - G_{reactants}$ => $\triangle G = \triangle H - T\triangle S$
* The potential energy is the energy of state; Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, which can do work
  * Potential: chemical bonds, concentration gradient, electric charge imbalance
  * Kinetic: heat
  * Potential <-> Kinetic
* Laws of thermodynamics
  * Energy cannot be created or destroyed
  * Energy transformations decrease the amount of energy for work and increase disorder
* The change in free energy determines its point of chemical equ. (The forward and reverse reactions proceed at the same rate)
* An exergonic reaction -> release free energy, -$\triangle G$; An endergonic reaction -> consumes free energy, +$\triangle G$
* Metabolism = the sum of all biochemical reactions; Catabolic reactions, breakdown of complex molecules and release energy; Anabolic reactions build complexity in the cell and are endergonic.
* Catabolic: Complex molecules -> free energy + small molecules
* Anabolic: Free energy + small molecules -> complex molecules
* Standard laboratory condition: $25^oC$, one atmosphere pressure, one molar concentration of the solutes, pH7. The standard free energy change under standard condition is $\triangle G^{o'}$

textbook 8.3

* The more negative the $\triangle G$ is, the further the reaction proceeds toward completion.
* Catalyst does not cause a reaction to occur, but merely increases the rate of the reaction
* To speed up a reaction, an energy barrier must be overcome
* Enzymes lower the energy barrier but do not affect equilibrium.

textbook 8.4

* Most enzymes are much larger than their substrates
* The active site is specific to the substrates
  * a substrate can be oriented correctly, chemically modified, or strained
* Induced fit: The change in enzyme shape caused by substrate binding
  * Induced fit explains why enzymes are so large
* Some enzymes require other cofactors to carry out catalysis
  * A coenzyme can be considered a substrate, it is changed by the reaction and then released from the enzyme
* Substrate concentration affects the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reaction

textbook 8.5

* Metabolism is organized into pathways in which the product of one reaction is a reactant for the next reaction.
* ENzymes can be regulated by inhibitors
  * If an inhibitor covalently binds to certain side chains at the active site of an enzyme, it will per- manently inactivate the enzyme by destroying its capacity to interact with its normal substrate.
  * The inhibition is reversible because if the con- centration of substrate is increased or if the concentration of inhibitor is reduced, the substrate is more likely to bind, and the enzyme is active again.
  * A competitive inhibitor binds to the active site, preventing substrate binding.
  * An uncompetitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme–substrate complex, preventing release of products.
  * A noncompetitive inhibitor binds at a site other than the active site, changing enzyme structure so that normal substrate binding cannot occur.
* The first reaction in a metabolic pathway is referred to as the commitment step.
* Enzymes are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and pH.
  * pH decreases -> more H+ -> react with $COO^-$ -> no longer negatively charged -> no longer interact with positively charged groups in the protein -> the folding of the protein may be altered
  * Temperature increase -> the reaction rate increase -> temperature too high -> reaction drops abruptly
  * Most enzymes in humans are more stable at high temperatures than those of the bacteria that infect us, so that a moderate fever tends to denature bacterial enzymes, but not our own.

Learn carbohydrates

Textbook: 3.3

* Carbohydrates is not actually hydrates even though it has the form of $C_m(H_2O)_n$. The water molecules are not intact.
* Cells use glucose as energy source
  * Glucose exists in straight chains and in ring forms. Ring form is more stable.
* The absence of this oxygen atom is an important distinction between RNA and DNA. (five carbon sugar)
* maltose can be hydrolyzed into its monosaccharides in the hu- man body, whereas cellobiose cannot.
  * maltose = $\alpha-D-Glucose$ + $\beta-D-Glucose$
  * cellobiose = $\beta-D-Glucose$ + $\beta-D-Glucose$
* The different human blood groups (for example, the ABO blood types) get their specificities from oligosaccharide chains. 
* Both glycogen and starch are readily hydrolyzed into glucose monomers, which in turn can be bro- ken down to liberate their stored energy.
  * Glycogen store glucose in the liver and muscles
  * Large starch aggregates called starch grains can be observed in the storage tissues of plant seeds
* Cellulose, however, is chemically more stable because of its β-glycosidic linkages.

NUCLEIC ACIDS -> DNA/RNA
* DNA must exist as complementary strands
  * A <-> T (2 hydrogen bonds)
  * C <-> G (3 hydrogen bonds)

4.1 What are the chemical structures and functions of nucleic acids
* The unique functions of the nucleic acids—DNA and RNA—are information storage and transfer.
* Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.
  * A nucleotide consists of three components: a nitrogen-containing base, a pentose sugar, and one to three phosphate groups 
* In DNA, the nucleotide bases are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Uracil (U) replaces thymine in RNA.
* Complementary base pairing due to hydrogen bonds between A and T, A and U, and G and C occurs in nucleic acids.
* DNA is expressed as RNA in transcription. RNA can then specify the amino acid sequence of a protein in translation.
* RNA is usually a single strand.
* In contrast to RNA’s diversity in three-dimensional structure, DNA is remarkably uniform.
* DNA carries information and is expressed through RNA
  * The DNA sequences that encode specific proteins are transcribed into RNA.

13.1

* Griffith’s experiments in the 1920s demonstrated that some substance in cells can cause heritable changes in other cells.
  * Griffith concluded that in the presence of the dead S-type pneumococcus cells, some of the living R-type cells had been trans- formed into virulent S cells.
* Avery and his colleagues isolated the transforming principle from bacteria and identified it as DNA.
* The Hershey–Chase experiments established conclusively that DNA (and not protein) is the genetic material, by tracing the DNA of radioactively labeled viruses, with which they infected bacterial cells.
* Transformation and transfection can be studied with the aid of a genetic marker gene that confers a known and observable phenotype.
  * Any cell can be transfected, even an egg cell.

13.2

* Chargaff’s rule states that the amount of adenine in DNA is equal to the amount of thymine, and that the amount of guanine is equal to the amount of cytosine; thus the total abundance of purines (A + G) equals the total abundance of pyrimidines (T + C).
* X-ray crystallography showed that the DNA molecule is a double helix.
* Complementary base pairing between A and T and between G and C accounts for Chargaff’s rule. The bases are held together by hydrogen bonding.
  * DNA is usually a right-handed helix.
  * DNA is antiparallel
  * DNA has major and minor grooves in which the outer edges of the nitrogenous bases are exposed.
* Reactive groups are exposed in the paired bases, allowing for rec- ognition by other molecules such as proteins.

* Isotopes used as tracer and marker
  * You can locate the DNA with Isotopes.

  * The replication is a semi-conservative process
* Template driven polymer

Read 14.5

* During translation, amino acids are linked together in the order specified by the codons in the mRNA. This task is achieved by tRNAs, which bind to (are charged with) specific amino acids.
* Each tRNA species has an amino acid attachment site as well as an anticodon complementary to a specific mRNA codon. A specific activating enzyme charges each tRNA with its specific amino acid.
  * the mRNA codon for arginine is 5′-CGG-3′, and the comple- mentary tRNA anticodon is 3′-GCC-5′.
  * For example, the presence of inosine in the tRNA with the anticodon 3′-CGI-5′ allows it to recognize and bind to three of the alanine codons: GCA, GCC, and GCU. 
  * each mRNA codon binds to just one tRNA species, carrying a specific amino acid.
* The ribosome is the molecular workbench where translation takes place. It has one large and one small subunit, both made of ribosomal RNA and proteins.
  * A ribosome can use any mRNA and all species of charged tRNAs
  * When not active in the translation of mRNA, the ribosomes exist as two separate subunits.
* Three sites on the large subunit of the ribosome interact with tRNA anticodons. The A site is where the charged tRNA anticodon binds to the mRNA codon; the P site is where the tRNA adds its amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain; and the E site is where the tRNA is released.
* Translation occurs in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. The initiation complex consists of tRNA bearing the first amino acid, the small ribosomal subunit, and mRNA. A specific complementary sequence on the small subunit rRNA binds to the transcription initiation site on the mRNA.
  * the mRNA start codon in the genetic code is AUG 
* The growing polypeptide chain is elongated by the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids, catalyzed by the rRNA.
* When a stop codon reaches the A site, it terminates translation by binding a release factor.
  * The elongation cycle ends, and translation is terminated, when a stop codon—UAA, UAG, or UGA—enters. These codons do not cor- A respond with any amino acids, 
* In a polysome, more than one ribosome moves along a strand of mRNA at one time.

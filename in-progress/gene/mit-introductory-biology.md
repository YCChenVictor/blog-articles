  ```
  * $-COOH -> -COO^- + H^+$
  * $-NH_2 + H ^+ -> -NH_3^+$

* The tertiary structure of a protein is formed by bending and folding
* Heat protein -> Denatured -> break secondary and tertiary structure -> cool down -> in some cases, the protein returns to normal structure, meaning the shape is contained in its primary structure
* The quaternary structure of a protein consists of subunits, one tertiary structure
* The shape and surface further determines the protein function
  * Only certain shape of protein can fit into another shape of protein
* Molecular Chaperones protect proteins from inappropriate binding

Read text: 8.1, 8.3 - 8.5 (read the summary first, the summary is in the end of the chapter)

textbook 8.1

* The usable energy is free energy; The unusable energy is entropy
  * $H = G + TS$ (total energy = usable energy + unusable energy, T is absolute temperature and S is entropy)
  * $\triangle G_{reaction} = G_{product} - G_{reactants}$ => $\triangle G = \triangle H - T\triangle S$
* The potential energy is the energy of state; Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, which can do work
  * Potential: chemical bonds, concentration gradient, electric charge imbalance
  * Kinetic: heat
  * Potential <-> Kinetic
* Laws of thermodynamics
  * Energy cannot be created or destroyed
  * Energy transformations decrease the amount of energy for work and increase disorder
* The change in free energy determines its point of chemical equ. (The forward and reverse reactions proceed at the same rate)
* An exergonic reaction -> release free energy, -$\triangle G$; An endergonic reaction -> consumes free energy, +$\triangle G$
* Metabolism = the sum of all biochemical reactions; Catabolic reactions, breakdown of complex molecules and release energy; Anabolic reactions build complexity in the cell and are endergonic.
* Catabolic: Complex molecules -> free energy + small molecules
* Anabolic: Free energy + small molecules -> complex molecules
* Standard laboratory condition: $25^oC$, one atmosphere pressure, one molar concentration of the solutes, pH7. The standard free energy change under standard condition is $\triangle G^{o'}$

textbook 8.3

* The more negative the $\triangle G$ is, the further the reaction proceeds toward completion.
* Catalyst does not cause a reaction to occur, but merely increases the rate of the reaction
* To speed up a reaction, an energy barrier must be overcome
* Enzymes lower the energy barrier but do not affect equilibrium.

textbook 8.4

* Most enzymes are much larger than their substrates
* The active site is specific to the substrates
  * a substrate can be oriented correctly, chemically modified, or strained
* Induced fit: The change in enzyme shape caused by substrate binding
  * Induced fit explains why enzymes are so large
* Some enzymes require other cofactors to carry out catalysis
  * A coenzyme can be considered a substrate, it is changed by the reaction and then released from the enzyme
* Substrate concentration affects the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reaction

textbook 8.5

* Metabolism is organized into pathways in which the product of one reaction is a reactant for the next reaction.
* ENzymes can be regulated by inhibitors
  * If an inhibitor covalently binds to certain side chains at the active site of an enzyme, it will per- manently inactivate the enzyme by destroying its capacity to interact with its normal substrate.
  * The inhibition is reversible because if the con- centration of substrate is increased or if the concentration of inhibitor is reduced, the substrate is more likely to bind, and the enzyme is active again.
  * A competitive inhibitor binds to the active site, preventing substrate binding.
  * An uncompetitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme–substrate complex, preventing release of products.
  * A noncompetitive inhibitor binds at a site other than the active site, changing enzyme structure so that normal substrate binding cannot occur.
* The first reaction in a metabolic pathway is referred to as the commitment step.
* Enzymes are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and pH.
  * pH decreases -> more H+ -> react with $COO^-$ -> no longer negatively charged -> no longer interact with positively charged groups in the protein -> the folding of the protein may be altered
  * Temperature increase -> the reaction rate increase -> temperature too high -> reaction drops abruptly
  * Most enzymes in humans are more stable at high temperatures than those of the bacteria that infect us, so that a moderate fever tends to denature bacterial enzymes, but not our own.

Learn carbohydrates

Textbook: 3.3

* Carbohydrates is not actually hydrates even though it has the form of $C_m(H_2O)_n$. The water molecules are not intact.
* Cells use glucose as energy source
  * Glucose exists in straight chains and in ring forms. Ring form is more stable.
* The absence of this oxygen atom is an important distinction between RNA and DNA. (five carbon sugar)
* maltose can be hydrolyzed into its monosaccharides in the hu- man body, whereas cellobiose cannot.
  * maltose = $\alpha-D-Glucose$ + $\beta-D-Glucose$
  * cellobiose = $\beta-D-Glucose$ + $\beta-D-Glucose$
* The different human blood groups (for example, the ABO blood types) get their specificities from oligosaccharide chains. 
* Both glycogen and starch are readily hydrolyzed into glucose monomers, which in turn can be bro- ken down to liberate their stored energy.
  * Glycogen store glucose in the liver and muscles
  * Large starch aggregates called starch grains can be observed in the storage tissues of plant seeds
* Cellulose, however, is chemically more stable because of its β-glycosidic linkages.

  * 2-Deoxy Ribose -> DNA
  * Ribose -> RNA
* We have enzyme to break Glycogen but Cellulose. That's why we can get energy from Glycogen.

NUCLEIC ACIDS -> DNA/RNA
* DNA must exist as complementary strands
  * A <-> T (2 hydrogen bonds)
  * C <-> G (3 hydrogen bonds)

4.1 What are the chemical structures and functions of nucleic acids
* The unique functions of the nucleic acids—DNA and RNA—are information storage and transfer.
* Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.
  * A nucleotide consists of three components: a nitrogen-containing base, a pentose sugar, and one to three phosphate groups 
* In DNA, the nucleotide bases are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Uracil (U) replaces thymine in RNA.
* Complementary base pairing due to hydrogen bonds between A and T, A and U, and G and C occurs in nucleic acids.
* DNA is expressed as RNA in transcription. RNA can then specify the amino acid sequence of a protein in translation.
* RNA is usually a single strand.
* In contrast to RNA’s diversity in three-dimensional structure, DNA is remarkably uniform.
* DNA carries information and is expressed through RNA
  * The DNA sequences that encode specific proteins are transcribed into RNA.

13.1

* Griffith’s experiments in the 1920s demonstrated that some substance in cells can cause heritable changes in other cells.
  * Griffith concluded that in the presence of the dead S-type pneumococcus cells, some of the living R-type cells had been trans- formed into virulent S cells.
* Avery and his colleagues isolated the transforming principle from bacteria and identified it as DNA.
* The Hershey–Chase experiments established conclusively that DNA (and not protein) is the genetic material, by tracing the DNA of radioactively labeled viruses, with which they infected bacterial cells.
* Transformation and transfection can be studied with the aid of a genetic marker gene that confers a known and observable phenotype.
  * Any cell can be transfected, even an egg cell.

13.2

* Chargaff’s rule states that the amount of adenine in DNA is equal to the amount of thymine, and that the amount of guanine is equal to the amount of cytosine; thus the total abundance of purines (A + G) equals the total abundance of pyrimidines (T + C).
* X-ray crystallography showed that the DNA molecule is a double helix.
* Complementary base pairing between A and T and between G and C accounts for Chargaff’s rule. The bases are held together by hydrogen bonding.
  * DNA is usually a right-handed helix.
  * DNA is antiparallel
  * DNA has major and minor grooves in which the outer edges of the nitrogenous bases are exposed.
* Reactive groups are exposed in the paired bases, allowing for rec- ognition by other molecules such as proteins.

Course 7

* Isotopes used as tracer and marker
  * You can locate the DNA with Isotopes.
  * When replication, new parts of DNA with non-isotopes were created. Through observing the position of isotopes and non-isotopes, we can understand the process of the replication.
  * The replication is a semi-conservative process
* Template driven polymer
  * AT place start the replication because there are three bonds here
  * helicase separates the strands of DNA
  * single strand binding protein attached to prevent single strand DNA bind again when replication.
  * Topoisomerase cut the DNA

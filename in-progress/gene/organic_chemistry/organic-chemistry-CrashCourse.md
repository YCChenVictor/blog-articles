Crash Course Organic Chemistry

* organic chemistry studies structure with carbon
* 3-CHLORO-2,4-DIMETHYLHEXANE (Course 3)
  ```smiles
  CC(C)C(Cl)C(C)CC
  ```
* orbital hybridization (Course 4)
* IR Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry (Course 5)
* Torsion energy (Course 6)
* Ring strain comes from angular strain and torsional strain (Course 7)
  * High strain means more energy and more instability
  * Cyclohexanes is favorable (lower energy)
* Stereochemistry (Course 8)
  * Simple geometric difference with same chemistry structure -> one can be digested, one be ignored
* Chirality and Optical Activity in Stereochemistry (Course 9)
  * Enantiomers of chiral molecules rotate plane-polarized light in opposite direction
  * Measuring enantiomeric excess in an unequal mixture of enantiomers with a polarimeter
    * By knowing the specific rotations of the pure enantiomers, the enantiomeric excess (ee) can be calculated, indicating the predominance of one enantiomer over the other in a mixture.
  * racemic mixtures contain equal amounts of enantiomers and don't rotate plane-polarized light
    * cancel each other out
* Molecular Structure and Bonding in Chemistry (Course 10)
  * Electronegativity describes how atoms attract electrons differently, which can lead to dipoles in some molecules
  * Resonance structure have different arrangements of electrons
    * The electron pushing concept helps us find different arrangements
  * resonance hybrids are a mixture of resonance structures
    * With the mixture, we can show the true structure of a molecule
* Predict relative acidity (stabilize electron -> attract H+ -> stronger conjugate -> more acid) (Course 11)
  * Atom identity: More electronegative atoms attached to a hydrogen increase the acidity of the molecule by stabilizing the negative charge on the conjugate base.
  * Resonance stabilization: The presence of resonance structures that delocalize the negative charge on the conjugate base increases acidity by enhancing the stability of the conjugate base.
    * More Resonance structure -> electron moves in those atoms -> stronger electron -> H+ attached closer
  * The inductive effect: Electronegative substituents exerting an inductive effect withdraw electron density through sigma bonds, thereby increasing acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base.
  * The s character of the orbital: Higher s character in the hybrid orbital of the atom bonded to hydrogen increases acidity because the electron density is held closer to the nucleus, stabilizing the negative charge on the conjugate base.
* Nucleophiles and Electrophiles (course 12)
  * Nucleophiles are lewis bases that donate electrons and attack electrophiles
    * they like nucleus -> they are negative charged
  * Electrophiles are lewis acids that are attacked by nucleophiles
    * they like electron -> they are positive charged; ex: H+
  * IR spectra can help us understand if a reaction really does happen
  * cyanide is more than just a poison
* Reaction Mechanisms (course 13)
  * How to write reaction mechanism
    * Should find the rules in it
  * strong acids in water should be considered hydronium ions or sources of protons
  * electron rich atoms or regions of molecules are attracted to electron-poor atoms or regions of molecules
* Alkene (course 14): during all the reaction, it is always finding the more stable form
  * naming alkenes using the E/Z system
  * MARKOVNIKOV's rule:  indicating which carbon atom of the double bond will receive the hydrogen atom
  * the inductive effect and hyperconjugation
    * inductive effect refers to the shift of electrons
    * hyperconjugation explains the stabilization of molecules
  * 1,2 hydride and 1,2-alkyl shift: rearrangement steps that can occur in certain alkene reactions
* Thermodynamics and Energy Diagrams (course 15)
  * thermodynamics
  * enthalpy
  * entrophy
  * GIBBS free energy
    * free energy diagram of chemical reactions
  * difference between an intermediate and a transition state
  * catalyst lower the activation energy energy of a reaction
* alkene addition reactions (course 16)
  * what is being added across the alkene
  * regioselectivity (where will the groups add)
  * stereochemistry (what is the expected stereochemistry of the added group)
    * syn or anti addition
* Alkene Redox Reactions (course 17)
  * Oxidation and reduction in organic molecules
    * losing electron is oxidation and gaining electron is reduction
  * Add Two alcohol groups to an alkene, both syn and anti
  * Use ozonolysis ($O_3$) to cleave a double bond
* Alkyne Reactions & Tautomerization (keto -> enol)

* Radical Reactions & Hammond's Postulate (course 19)
  * Radical Reactions: A reaction will initiate other surrounding reactions -> increase stability
    * Radical Reaction is faster than addition reaction
  * Hammond's Postulate: The major product will the the one release more energy, which is more stable

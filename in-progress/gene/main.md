# Title

## Purpose

The study of genes serves to understand how inherited information is encoded, transmitted, and expressed in organisms, contributing to insights into various biological processes and potential applications in fields like medicine and agriculture.

## Concept

Genes are studied through various techniques such as DNA sequencing, genetic mapping, gene expression analysis, and molecular biology experiments to decipher their structure, function, and interactions within organisms.

### DNA sequencing

DNA sequencing is a technique used to determine the precise order of nucleotides (A, T, C, and G) **within a DNA molecule**.

The steps:

* Break down DNA into smaller fragments
* Add labeled nucleotides
* Reconstruct the original sequence of the DNA molecule by the label nucleotides because labeled nucleotides may overlap each other

In general, one DNA molecule composes a chromosome.

### Genetic mapping

It determines the positions of genes on **chromosomes**. It provides information about the order of genes along a chromosome, the distances between genes, and how genes are inherited together due to their physical proximity on the same chromosome. This mapping is crucial for understanding the genetic makeup of organisms and the inheritance patterns of traits and diseases.

### Gene Expression Analysis

Gene expression analysis is the study of how genes are activated to produce functional molecules like proteins, offering insights into biological processes and diseases. This is achieved through methods like microarrays or RNA sequencing, which quantify RNA levels to understand cellular activities.

#### Reproductive Behaviors

Gene expression analysis involves studying how genes are activated or turned off in specific cells or tissues. In the context of the desire to have children, researchers have investigated the role of gene expression patterns in areas of the brain associated with reproductive behavior and decision-making.

* neurotransmitters: Play a role in the desire to have children by influencing brain circuits and emotional states that contribute to reproductive motivations and behaviors.
* hormones: Play a crucial role in various aspects of reproduction and parenting behaviors, influencing fertility, pregnancy, bonding, and caregiving tendencies in individuals.
* epigenetic: For example, if someone grows up in an environment with nurturing and supportive parenting models, positive emotional associations with family life might be epigenetically reinforced, potentially leading to a stronger desire to have children themselves.

Genes can influence the function of neurotransmitters and hormones, which in turn affect the brain's reward pathways. If an individual's genetic makeup leads to a stronger reward response associated with the idea of having children, it could increase the likelihood of them wanting to have children.

Also, genetic factors can make individuals more or less prone to certain epigenetic changes in response to their environment, and these epigenetic changes can subsequently influence an individual's desires and decisions regarding having children.

##### Why to reproduce

If humans had infinite life spans, the drive to reproduce might be significantly diminished, as one of the primary purposes of reproduction is to pass on one's genetic legacy and ensure the survival of future generations. We all die, so we want to reproduce.

##### Increase probability of having children

Before fatherhood

* Neurotransmitters:
  * Men may experience varying levels of motivation and desire for emotional connections, influenced by dopamine, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters related to pleasure and bonding.
  * Emotional experiences, relationships, and life goals can shape these desires.
* Hormones:
  * Testosterone levels play a role in men's sexual desire and behavior. High levels might be associated with increased interest in romantic and sexual relationships.
  * Emotional connections and life circumstances can influence hormonal responses.
* Epigenetic Influences:
  * An individual's life experiences, upbringing, and environmental factors can impact epigenetic patterns related to emotional responses, social interactions, and bonding tendencies.
  * Genetic predispositions interact with these factors to shape desires and motivations.

After fatherhood

* Neurotransmitters:
  * Men can experience increased levels of oxytocin, the "bonding hormone," through interactions with their children and supportive caregiving.
* Hormones:
  * Testosterone levels might experience fluctuations, with some studies suggesting that fatherhood can lead to reduced testosterone levels in men, potentially influencing their behavior and nurturing tendencies.
* Epigenetic Influences:
  * Engaging in active and positive fatherhood roles can potentially impact men's epigenetic patterns, particularly in genes associated with caregiving and emotional bonding.

#### Dopamine

Dopamine is created through a series of enzymatic reactions starting from the amino acid tyrosine. Once synthesized, it's transported to the brain through specialized dopamine transporters located on cell membranes.

Genes play a significant role in regulating the entire process of dopamine creation, transportation, and signaling in the brain. Variations in genes related to dopamine synthesis, transporters, and receptors can influence how dopamine is produced, released, and received in neural circuits.

##### Variations

Genetic variations can impact the structure or function of proteins involved in the dopamine pathway. For example, certain gene variants might lead to overactive or underactive dopamine production, altered dopamine receptor sensitivity, or changes in the efficiency of dopamine transporters. These variations can influence an individual's susceptibility to conditions like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, or addiction, as well as their responses to drugs that target the dopamine system. Studying these genetic variations through gene expression analysis can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of these conditions and potentially guide personalized treatments.

##### Cures

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily associated with the accumulation of synuclein alpha (SNCA) protein leading to **dopamine depletion**, causing motor and non-motor symptoms. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to PD, with ongoing research exploring gene therapy approaches, like **silencing or replacing flawed genes**, offering potential benefits with fewer adverse effects compared to conventional treatments like levodopa and MAO-B inhibitors, aiming at either stopping neuron degeneration (disease-modifying) or enhancing dopamine expression (non-disease modifying).

### Basic Knowledge

#### Biology

Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms, encompassing a vast range of topics from the molecular and cellular levels to the interactions between organisms and their environments. It seeks to understand the processes, structures, functions, and diversity of life forms, providing insights into the fundamental principles that govern life on Earth.

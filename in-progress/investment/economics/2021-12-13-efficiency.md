## Intro

I think pareto efficiency has the adequate explanation for economics efficiency and I am going to use it to explore opportunities.

An economy achieves pareto efficiency if all the stakeholders has no means to feel better without hurting someone. For example, in the supply side, there is no way to reallocate resources to increase two prodction at the same time.

## Why

I believe technology can bring more welfare to everyone in the world and the opportunity lies on the space of efficiency produced by advance in technologies.

## How

The analysis steps:

1. decompose market into demand side and supply side
2. In the demand side, if a technology increases a consumer's satisfaction or lower a consumer's cost to gain the same satifaction, then it works.
3. In the supply side, if a technology decrease the cost of production or increase a company's revenue, then it works.
4. Please focus on how to help "one" consumer or "one" company and then think whether it could be a big market.

## What

Remember that there are smart guys out there, so I can only find a good startup in the edge technologies such as meta, blockchain for now.

### Music Industry

Because I like music, I dive into this industry first. Dive into current value chain and find opportunities.

#### Demand

When human listen to music, brains release dopamine by human anticipating the peak emotion and then actually experience it. A technology which can increase the degree of this process can be a good startup.

The aspects of this degree:

1. frequency: increase the frequency -> no idea
2. density: increase the density -> no idea

#### Supply

The value chain in music industry as follow:
creation -> production -> product management -> sales/marketing -> distribution -> platform -> consumption

1. consumption:
   1. Meta for environment for live perofrmance (enjoy live with lower cost)
   2. blockchain for music copyright
   3. blockchain for ownership

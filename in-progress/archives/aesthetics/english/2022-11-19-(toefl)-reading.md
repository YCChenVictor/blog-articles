## Introduction

This article describes the concept and techniques of reading.

## Why?

Completing the TOEFL reading section can improve your reading comprehension skills, expand your vocabulary, and develop critical thinking abilities necessary for academic and professional success in English-speaking environments.

## How?

### General Idea

Steps to answer questions:

* 3 reading passage, 30 questions, 54 minutes
* Draw template
* Analyze question's category
* Utilize answer strategy
* Technique
  * Skim: walk through passage and drop down conclusion note
  * Scan: directly find the keyword
* Question Types
  * Vocabulary
  * Reference
  * Lead Word/ Detail
  * Rhetorical Purpose
  * Paraphrase
  * Sentence Insertion
  * EXCEPT/NOT/LEAST
  * Inference
  * Summary

### Vocabulary

* Identification: when the question asks the meaning of particular vocabulary
* Steps
  * If this vocabulary is in subject of a sentence, check the prior sentence. If this vocabulary is in object of a sentence, check the later sentence.
  * If this vocabulary is verb, check the effect in near sentences
  * Drop down key points of that checked sentence and choose answer based on key points
* Example
  * Question: what's the closest meaning to the word, `abolished` in the following sentences: In 1857, in return for a payment of 63 million kronor from other commercial nations, Denmark **abolished** the Sound toll dues the fees it had collected since 1497 for the use of the Sound. This, along with other policy shifts toward free trade, resulted in a significant increase in traffic through the Sound and in the port of Copenhagen.
  * Answer: Because this is the verb, we check the effect: increase the traffic -> the fees must be lower -> A or D -> the meaning of abolish is end

### Reference

Identification: when pronoun

### Lead Word/ Detail

* Identification
  * When a question starts from 'according to'
  * Ends with 'which of the following'
  * Mentioned number of paragraph specifically
* Steps
  * Find keyword in question
  * Scan article to find the keyword
  * If find the keyword, write down the key point of that sentence containing the keyword
  * If no keyword in passage, drop the inference why author write this passage (usually on the first and last sentences)
  * choose the answer
* Example

### Rhetorical Purpose

* Identification
  * The author discusses X in paragraph 2 in order to...
  * Why does the author mention X?
  * The author uses X as an example of
  * How is paragraph 3 organized?
  * How is paragraph 1 and 2 related?
* Steps
  * Mindset: academic articles all have structure of main idea and then details
  * find where the key word in question is
  * determine whether this sentence is main or detail
  * If main, then the answer is in details and should summarize the details
  * If detail, then the answer is in main and should summarize the main
* example

### Paraphrase

#### Category of paraphrase

It will highlight the sentences and want us to paraphrase them.

#### steps of paraphrase

* use sentence structure to find out the most important information
  * trim the sentence into S.V.O
  * and also get the attitude
* write down own idea
* choose the answer

### Sentence Insertion

#### Steps of Sentence Insertion

Steps:

* Decompose the sentence into prior information and later information
* Skim through the whole paragraph and find the only keyword of each sentence
* Pair prior and later information to these key words. If these information matches the key words, then it is where to insert

For example, try to insert

**This economics reliance on livestock in certain regions makes large tracts of land susceptible to overgrazing.**

into

(A). The raising of livestock is a major economic activity in semiarid lands, where grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation. (B). The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. (C). This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and accelerated erosion. (D).

---

##### Step 1

prior information: economics reliance
later information: overgrazing

##### Step 2

(A) -> livestock -> economic -> (B) -> grazing -> vegetation, soil -> drying, erosion -> (D)

##### Step 3

Choose B

### EXCEPT/NOT/LEAST

#### Steps for EXCEPT/NOT/LEAST

Steps

* If no impression, skim to understand the passage (drop down conclusion notes) and then scan options
* If having impression, scan the options
* mark the options as true or false

For example,

The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the initial 'peepshow' format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater. In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison's peepshow device, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot film at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).

and the question:

According the this paragraph, all of the following were true of viewing films in Kinetoscope parlors EXCEPT:

(A) One individual at a time viewed a film
(B) Customers could view one film after another
(C) Prizefights wre the most popular subject for films
(D) Each film was short

---

##### Step 1 (skim)

Draw rectangle and input the key point

##### Step 2 (scan)

Walk through the question and check T/F based on the passage

### Inference

#### Category of Inference

This kind of question is to infer why author write this passage.

#### Steps of Inference

Steps

* Skim the passage and drop key point
* Think why author wrote this passage and write down self inference -> please summarize the paragraph first
* Scan the options and eliminate the extreme answer

For example,

The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process. Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil to form. In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and over-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface.

---

##### Step 1 for Inference Question

Skim and drop the notes: people, vast cause desertification (-) and to prevent them, we need protection and time

##### Step 2 for Inference Question

To appeal for actions to prevent deterioration

##### Step 3 for Inference Question

(A) Governments will act quickly to control further desertification (x, extreme)
(B) The factors influencing desertification occur in cycles and will change in the future (x, the factors are the same)
(C) Desertification will continue to increase (o, to appeal)
(D) Desertification will soon occur in all areas of the world (x, extreme)

### Summary

We need to select three summaries for this question

Steps

* Read first sentence and last sentence of first paragraph and last paragraph to drop down main idea and purpose
* read first sentence of other paragraph and drop down the key points
* remove options that are too detailed
* remove wrong inference options

For example, for TPO 17 R3, the notes is as follow:

1. symbiotic relationship: parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism
2. parasitism, one better, one worse
3. natural selection of parasitism
4. commensalism, only one better, few
5. mutualism, both better
6. depends on connections among organisms

main: 3 types
purpose: explain them
structure:  parasitism -> commensalism -> mutualism

(A) true according to 2
(B) false according to 5
(C) true according to 5
(D) 
(E) true according to 4
(F) 

## What?

### Vocabulary Review

* TPO 17 R1 (1):
  * impetus is in O: read the after sentence
  * summary after sentence: made the idea irresistible
  * so we should choose the one, promoting something
  * retrospect
    * not enough vocabulary size
    * but I get the right key point
* TPO 18 R1 (6):
  * 

### Lead Word/ Detail Review

* TPO 17 R1 (2):
  * keyword: new way -> last sentence
  * key point: maintain the traditional routes -> C or D
  * summary the paragraph -> political
  * retrospect
    * problem of overgeneralization in C -> costly
* TPO 18 R1 (1):
  * keyword: England/Germany
  * key point: four country developed later -> strange (England/Germany -><- four country)
  * summary the paragraph -> coal

It seems that we still need to summarize this paragraph for this kind of question

### Inference Review

* TPO 17 R3 (5)
  * the keyword in Q is rabbit population
  * the keyword in the sentence containing wording, rabbit population, is deliberately introduced
  * think why author wrote this paragraph -> to show the effect of deliberately introducing
* TPO 18 R1 (9)
  * the summary is no significant barriers
  * but the question asks protectionist, which is paradox
  * so to infer why, we should choose B (exception)

### Insertion Review

* TPO 17 R3 (13)
  * Q's information: massive pop. -> problem
  * overrun by huge rabbits -> (A) -> destroy expanses -> (B) -> deliberately introduced -> (C) -> devastated pop. -> (D) -> less deadly to offspring
  * massive population maps to huge rabbits and problem maps to destroy expanses

### Summary Review

* TPO 17 R2 and there are five paragraphs

1. light varies => quite conspicuous
2. send signals => change color
3. take account in changes of light => compete for best light
4. Y/G color predominate => O/Y color visible
5. rely other form => sound

Main: animal signal
Purpose: examples
Structure: environment -> change color -> with light -> contrast with light -> sound

A. Animals that have different predators at different times of day change color to avoid being detected
B. To be noticed, an animal may draw attention to the contrast between its colors and the colors of its environment
C. Yellow and green are the most common colors found in the rain forest
D. To escape notice, an animal may move or change color so that its color pattern is not visible
E. Animals must have signals for aggression as well as to indicate readiness to mate
F. An animal may use sound rather than color to attract attention, because sound signals are not hindered by light conditions

A => maybe topic
B => topic of 4
C => not topic
D => topic of 2
E => must (x)
F => topic of 5

## Why?

Preparing for the TOEFL writing section can help you develop effective written communication skills, enhance your ability to express complex ideas in a structured manner, and demonstrate your proficiency in English writing, which is essential for academic and professional pursuits.

## How?

* Integrated writing task (20 minutes)
* Independent writing task (30 minutes)

### Independent Writing

* After reading the question, find the main topic of this question and list three main aspects this topic cares based on the self perspective and environment provided in this question
* think about or write down 6 points of each aspect to fill in the structure
  * positive example
    * (1) what it is
    * (2) details
    * (3) how large is the effect
  * negative example
    * (4) what it is
    * (5) details
    * (6) how large is the effect
* Example of six points: First of all, the government generally places emphasis on budget control (<- 1), and preserving old buildings can help it successfully save its budget. For instance, when the Taiwanese government decided to fix the Western wing of National Palace Museum, it only spent 20,000 US dollars to repair the ancient main entrance. Moreover, repainting the walls merely cost 1,000 US dollars. (<- 2) As a result, the government saved up to 50% of the original budget. (<- 3) on the other hand, if it decided to build a brand new monument, such as Taipei 101 (<- 4), it would have spent at least 1 million US dollars to import expensive materials from England. Furthermore, hiring workers and engineers would have easily amounted to 2 million US dollars. (<- 5) Apparently, the new project might have totally exceed the budget. (<- 6)
* Template of independent writing
  * Question: Should xxx do yyy?
  * Template:
    ```bash
    People often possess different perspective on (yyy). As for me, I strongly argue that (xxx should do yyy).

    First of all, xxx cares about (1) and yyy can help (1). For example, when xxx decides to do (1-1), xxx only needs to (1-2). As a result, (1-3). On the other hand, if xxx decides to (1-4), xxx will cost (1-5). Apparently, (1-6)
    
    Secondly,...
    
    Last but not least,...
    
    In conclusion, the government obviously should preserve ancient buildings. After all, it seeks to controller the budget, preserve history, and gain higher reputation.
    ```

### Integration Writing

* Before reading
  * draw 6 grids
* While reading (3 mins)
  * Write down topic (first paragraph)
  * Write down the three reasons (second to fourth paragraph) in the article (all with S.V.O format)
* While listening (1.5 mins)
  * Write down what professor says sentence by sentences in each reason section in order
  * Make sure each section has main, detail, conclusion
* While writing
  * We can still read the article while writing
* Template of integration writing
  ```bash
  Both the reading and the lecture discuss xxx. The reading implies that yyy. However, the professor strongly disagrees with the reading passage.

  First of all, the reading passage mentions that (1). Yet, the lecturer severely challenges the theory by arguing that (1-opposite-main). Furthermore, he states that (1-opposite-detail). Therefore, (1-opposite-conclusion).
  
  Secondly, the passage suggests that (2). Nevertheless, the scholar seriously contradicts the hypothesis because (2-opposite-main). To elaborate, he contends that (2-opposite-detail). As a result, (2-opposite-conclusion).
  
  Last but not least, the reading indicates that (3). Once again, the speaker opposes the evidence revealed in the passage. To elaborate, (3-opposite-detail). Apparently, (3-opposite-conclusion). `(=> when skip the main while listening)`
  
  Inclusion, the professor argues against each theory in the reading. That is to say, he maintains that yyy-opposite.
  ```

## What?

### Integration Writing Review

* While reading
  * No need to write down all the details because we can compose with reading passage
  * make sure truly get the main point
* While listening

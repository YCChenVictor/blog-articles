### Reading

#### Test

You are given time to preview the questions before you listen. In Section 1, 2 and 3, you are given time at the start of the section and in the middle as well. In Section 4, you are given time only at the start of the section.

Also, you are given time to review your answers before moving on to the next section.

While you are listening, you can note your answers on the question page. You can transfer your answers to the answer sheet after the recording has finished (10 minutes in the Paper Based IELTS test).

#### Strategy

* Read instruction
* Read and understand the questions
* Highlight the keywords in the questions
* Think of synonyms and paraphrase (guess the context in the listening)
* Predict what they are going to talk if we can
* Listen to the whole section
* Put a tick beside the one you think might be answer
* Keep moving on

## Practice

* Practice full test with time limit
* Spot the weakness from the full test
* Practice the weakness section slowly again and move on to next full test
* If I need band 8 and get 8.5 for three times in practice, then we are ready to go. That is, we need to get at least target + 0.5 for three times during practice.
* If there is any incorrect answer, then it is wrong.

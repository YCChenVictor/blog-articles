## Introduction

quick explanation

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

### Listening

Develop active listening skills by focusing on understanding the main ideas, supporting details, and the speaker's tone or attitude. Practice note-taking techniques to capture important information and keywords while listening to lectures, conversations, or recordings and we can infer what questions should be.

* General steps
  * drop down template while explanation
    * conversation: T shape
    * lecture: 6 grids
  * while listening
    * cross line for conversation or six grid for lecture
    * make sure express v.o in notes
  * guess questions based on information in notes
    * main idea & purpose
    * conclusion (how)
    * (attitude)
    * (attitude change)
    * detail 1
    * detail 2
  * while answering
    * read questions
    * drop down keywords based on information before (must based on information in notes to avoid overgeneralization)
    * pick answer mentioned in the notes
  * Answer questions and grading
  * Now we know whether the guesses are correct. Based on the information, we can listen it again and drop down note again for keywords of those questions
  * Retrospect two different notes with key hints: main idea, conclusion, attitude, detail
* Conversation test
  * main idea
    * the speaker will tell us and we should write it down
  * conclusion
    * In the end of conversation, make sure to write down the conclusion
  * attitudes
    * must, surprising, interesting ...
    * emphasis: repetition, transition, heavy tone, pause, slow
  * details
    * definition
    * comparison
    * cause
* lecture

### Speaking

Engage in regular conversations with English speakers to improve fluency and pronunciation. Use a variety of language resources, such as language exchange partners or online speaking practice platforms, to gain confidence in expressing your ideas orally.

* Tasks
  * Task 1: personal information
    * listening
  * Task 2: campus situation
    * reading + listening
    * draw 6 grids
  * Task 3: lecture
    * reading + listening
    * draw T
  * Task 4
    * 
* Tones
  * rising tone
    * Yes/No Question
    * When there are still sentence to speak
  * rise and down tone
    * to emphasize a word
* Tests
  * Task 1
    * during preparation
      * Please memorize the template because I do not think we have time to write down template
      * read the question and write down the personal reason; for example, laziness and then write down the example and then write down conclusion
    * during speaking
      * In A/D questions, just need to speak out that `I agree or disagree the statement`
      * speak slowly
      * remember to speak the opposite example
      * try to paraphrase
      * think that you are talking to a person
      * conclusion should just use `That's way I think...`
  * Task 2

    * When reading
      * Decide university announces or student proposes
      * Write down announcement or proposal (S.V.O)
      * Write down the two reasons (S.V.O)
    * When listening

      * Write down the detail reason why the speaker agrees or disagrees
    * When 30 secs preparation
      * Decide transition words and restructure the sentences in 30 seconds preparation
      * Mark intonations (to show attitude)
    * When speaking
      * Focus on fluency
      * Focus on intonation
      * Slow down
  * Task 3

      * make sure how to spell the topic
      * write down as many S.V.O as possible to explain the term
    * when preparing
      * read through the dropdown sentences and draw intonation to make sure we know where to emphasize
      * write down transition words
  * Task 4
    * Steps: listening -> 20 seconds preparation -> 60 seconds answering
    * before listening
      * draw T
      * write down the template
        ```HTML
        Well, the professor illustrated the two reasons.
        
        Okay. The first reason is (First Topic); for example, xxxxxxxx (lots of transition words, S.V.O). So, yyyyy (first conclusion)
        
        The second reason is (Second Topic); for example, xxxxxxx (lots of transition words, S.V.O). So, yyyyyy (second conclusion)
        
        And that's how the professor explained the two reasons.
        ```
    * while listening
      * write down two topics
      * write down the examples: main idea -> detail -> conclusion
      * if there is weird word, make sure write down the spelling
    * while preparing
      * write down transition words
      * read through the sentences and draw intonations
      * if not enough sentences, try to create more sentences by paraphrasing
    * while speaking
      * slow down
      * intonations
* Retrospects from practices
  * Task 2
    * Speed up notes taking
    * Skim the announcement
    * Make sure to restructure **all** sentences on note in 30 seconds preparation
    * When we draw intonation, make sure to draw rising tone for key information and **each** sentence should have one
    * university should use announcement
  * Task 3
    * the speaking speed can be slower. take it easy
    * make sure to drop intonation mark because it make sure we know the notes we are taking and where to emphasize for restructuring the thoughts

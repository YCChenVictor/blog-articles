## Why?

We need music because it has the power to evoke emotions, inspire creativity, and unite people across cultures, providing a universal language that transcends barriers and enriches our lives.

## How?

In this article, I am going to produce a song from zero to publish.

* Songwriting
  * Concept
    * The structure of a [song]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/music/2023/05/06/song-writing.html). This can be done by a single person or a team of songwriters, and can be based on personal experiences, stories, or emotions.
    * lyrics (TBC)
    * I only know how to play guitar, so writing songs with my guitar is my primary way and guitar's unique tonal qualities can inspire creative [melodies and harmonies]({{site.baseurl}}/os/2023/04/02/overview.html).
  * Example
* Pre-production
  * Concept: Once the song is written, the next step is to develop a rough arrangement of the song. This can involve deciding on the structure of the song, the instrumentation, and the overall sound and feel of the music.
  * Example
* Recording
  * Concept: After the pre-production stage, the song is recorded. This can involve recording the instrumental parts and vocals separately or simultaneously, depending on the preference of the producer or artist.
  * I use Focusrite 2i2
* Editing
  * Concept: After recording, the individual tracks are edited and mixed together to create a final version of the song. This can involve adjusting levels, adding effects, and manipulating the sound of individual tracks.
* Mastering
  * Concept: Once the final mix is complete, the song is mastered, which involves optimizing the sound of the song for different playback systems, such as radio or streaming services.
* Distribution
  * Concept: After the song is mastered, it is ready for distribution. This can involve releasing the song through a record label, distributing it through online platforms, or promoting it through live performances.

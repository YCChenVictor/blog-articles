To draw face from imagination

## How?

Step 1: Start with the Basic Shapes
Begin by drawing a circle for the head. This will serve as the foundation for the face. You can lightly sketch the circle to guide you and erase it later.

Step 2: Divide the Face
Draw a vertical line down the center of the circle to divide the face into two equal halves. Then, draw a horizontal line across the middle of the circle. This line will help you position the eyes.

Step 3: Position the Facial Features
Using the horizontal line as a reference point, position the eyes along this line. Typically, the space between the eyes is approximately one eye's width. Draw almond-shaped eyes or any other eye shape you prefer.

Step 4: Add the Nose
Beneath the eyes and between them, draw a small triangle or oval shape to represent the nose. You can adjust the shape based on the style you're aiming for.

Step 5: Draw the Mouth
Below the nose, draw a curved line or a horizontal ellipse to create the mouth. The width of the mouth should be roughly the same as the distance between the eyes.

Step 6: Sketch the Ears
Position the ears on either side of the head, between the top of the eyes and the bottom of the nose. Ears can vary in shape and size, but a general guideline is to make them about the same height as the distance between the eyes.

Step 7: Define the Jawline and Chin
Draw a curved line from the bottom of one ear to the other to create the jawline. Then, add a curved line or shape below the mouth to indicate the chin. The jawline and chin will give structure to the face.

Step 8: Refine the Facial Features
Go over your initial sketches and refine the shapes of the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. Pay attention to details like eyelashes, eyebrows, nostrils, and any other defining features you'd like to include.

Step 9: Add Hair and Other Details
Draw the hair around the head, keeping in mind the general hairstyle you want. You can also add additional details like eyebrows, wrinkles, freckles, or facial hair, depending on the person you're drawing.

Step 10: Erase Guidelines and Refine
Once you're satisfied with the overall appearance of the face, erase any unnecessary guidelines you initially drew. Then, go over the drawing, adding shading, highlights, and further details to enhance the three-dimensional look of the face.

##### Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane):

* Purpose: To separate cell's internal environment from the external environment
* Concept: (?) How did it separates?
* Example: Semi-permeable barrier that surrounds the cell

##### Cytoplasm

For cellular metabolism, support cellular structures, facilitate intracellular transport, store and recycle materials, participate in cell signaling, and enable protein synthesis

* cellular metabolism
  * Purpose: To provide the necessary energy and building blocks for the cell to carry out its various functions, maintain its structure, grow, and reproduce. Additionally, cellular metabolism is responsible for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules essential for the cell's survival and overall functioning.
  * Concept: Cellular metabolism refers to the set of biochemical processes that occur within a cell to obtain, convert, and utilize energy from nutrients to sustain life, perform cellular functions, and synthesize essential molecules.
  * Example: Cellular respiration, a process occurring in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and is responsible for converting glucose and oxygen into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell, along with carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. ATP generated through cellular respiration powers various cellular activities, enabling cells to function and carry out essential processes necessary for life.

* support cellular structures
  * Purpose: To provide mechanical stability, maintain cell shape, and facilitate essential cellular processes through the cytoskeleton. 
  * Concept: Cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments and tubules that provides mechanical stability, shape, and facilitates intracellular transport within the cell.
  * Example: The most important example of supporting cellular structures is the role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining the shape and integrity of red blood cells, enabling them to be flexible and squeeze through narrow capillaries in the circulatory system.
* facilitate intracellular transport
  * Purpose: Ensure efficient movement of substances, organelles, and cellular components within a cell, supporting its functions, growth, division, and response to the environment.
  * Concept: The dynamic and coordinated process by which molecules, organelles, and cellular components are transported within a cell, utilizing the cytoskeleton and motor proteins to enable essential cellular functions and maintain cellular organization and homeostasis.
  * Example: The movement of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles within nerve cells, facilitated by motor proteins along the cytoskeleton, which allows for efficient synaptic transmission and communication between nerve cells in the nervous system.
* store and recycle materials
  * Purpose: Maintain cellular functions, support metabolism, and ensure cellular homeostasis.
  * Concept: Accumulate essential nutrients and molecules in the cytoplasm for future use while also breaking down and reusing waste products to maintain cellular functions and overall homeostasis.
  * Example: One of the most important examples of storing and recycling materials in the cell is the process of autophagy, where the cell's cytoplasm disassembles and degrades damaged organelles, proteins, and other cellular components to recycle their building blocks and maintain cellular health.
* participate in cell signaling
  * Purpose: Participate in cell signaling in the cytoplasm enables cells to communicate with one another and respond to external stimuli by transmitting and processing molecular signals that regulate key cellular activities, including growth, differentiation, metabolism, and survival.
  * Concept: Cell signaling involves a series of intricate molecular interactions that allow cells to perceive changes in their environment, convey information internally through complex signaling pathways, and produce appropriate responses, ensuring proper cellular function, growth, and survival.
  * Example: The insulin signaling pathway involves transmitting the insulin signal from the cell surface receptor to intracellular components in the cytoplasm, orchestrating specific cellular responses related to glucose uptake, storage, and metabolism.
* enable protein synthesis
  * Purpose: Protein synthesis in the cytoplasm is the essential process by which cells convert genetic information carried by mRNA into functional proteins, playing a central role in maintaining cellular functions and sustaining life in organisms. The cytoplasm provides the necessary environment for ribosomes to carry out translation, ensuring the accurate assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains that form diverse proteins crucial for cellular activities.
  * Concept: The concept of enabling protein synthesis in the cytoplasm is that the cytoplasm of a cell provides the necessary environment and machinery for the translation step of protein synthesis to occur. Ribosomes, the cellular organelles responsible for protein synthesis, are located in the cytoplasm, where they read the mRNA sequence and assemble amino acids into polypeptide chains, eventually forming functional proteins that play vital roles in various cellular processes and support the overall functioning of the organism.
  * Example: The cytoplasm enables protein synthesis by hosting ribosomes, which read mRNA and assemble amino acids into polypeptide chains, leading to the formation of functional proteins essential for cellular processes and organismal functions. This process ensures the translation of genetic information into tangible biological molecules, supporting life in cells and organisms.

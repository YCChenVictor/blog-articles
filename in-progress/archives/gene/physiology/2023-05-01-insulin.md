## Introduction

quick explanation

## Why?

focus on why we need it

## How?

* Insulin is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas in response to high levels of glucose in the blood, such as after a meal.
* Insulin acts on cells throughout the body to promote the uptake and storage of glucose, and helps to move glucose from the bloodstream into cells, where it can be used for energy or stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles.
  * Insulin binds to specific receptors on the surface of cells.
    * Insulin receptors are proteins located on the surface of cells that bind specifically to insulin molecules. These receptors are most commonly found on muscle, liver, and fat cells.
    * The binding of insulin to its receptor also triggers signaling pathways within the cell that regulate many other metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and gene expression.
  * This triggers a signaling pathway that causes transporters to move from inside the cell to the cell surface.
    * When insulin binds to its receptor, it causes a series of chemical reactions within the cell that lead to the activation of transporters that move glucose from the bloodstream into the cell.
      * Insulin binding to its receptor triggers a conformational change in the receptor, which activates an enzyme called tyrosine kinase that is associated with the receptor.
      * The activated tyrosine kinase then phosphorylates other proteins within the cell, including IRS (insulin receptor substrate) proteins, which act as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules.
        * `Tyrosine kinase + ATP + IRS protein → Phosphorylated IRS protein + ADP + Pi`
          * `C-tk + C10H12N5O13P3 + C-irs → P-C-irs + C10H12N5O10P2 + HPO4^2-`
            * C-tk represents the tyrosine kinase enzyme
            * C-irs represents the IRS (insulin receptor substrate) protein
            * P-C-irs represents the phosphorylated IRS protein
            * ATP is represented by C10H12N5O13P3 and the [image](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5461108#section=Structures)
            * ADP is represented by C10H12N5O10P2
            * Pi (inorganic phosphate) is represented by HPO4^2-
      * This phosphorylation cascade leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway, which ultimately results in the translocation of glucose transporter proteins, such as GLUT4, from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane, allowing for the uptake of glucose into the cell.
  * The transporters then facilitate the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into the cell, where it can be used for energy or stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles.
    * Transporters, such as GLUT4, are located on the surface of cells and act as gatekeepers for glucose entry.
    * Insulin promotes the translocation of GLUT4 transporters from inside the cell to the cell membrane, allowing more glucose to enter the cell.
    * Once inside the cell, glucose can be used for energy or stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles for later use.
* Insulin also helps to reduce the production of glucose by the liver, thereby helping to regulate blood glucose levels.

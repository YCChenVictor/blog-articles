## Introduction

This article starts by discussing solubility and then goes on to explain three different types of chemical reactions: precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions, and oxidation-reduction reactions. Each type of reaction is characterized by a different chemical process and can be identified based on the specific products that are formed.

## Why?

Understanding the different types of chemical reactions is important in order to predict and control chemical processes, as well as to explain the behavior of substances in a variety of settings.

## How?

### Solubility rules

A soluble compound can be dissolved in water.

* Always soluble: $$Na^+, K^+, Li^+, NH_4^+, NO_3^-, C_2H_3O_2^-$$
* Generally Soluble:
  * $$Cl^-, Br^-, I^-$$ (exception: $$Ag^+, Pb^{2+}, Hg_2^{2+}$$)
  * $$SO_4^{2-}$$ (exception: $$Ca^{2+}, Ba^{2+}, Sr^{2+}, Pb^{2+}$$)
* Generally Insoluble:
  * $$OH^-$$ (exception: $$Na^+, NH_4^-, Ca^{2+}, Sr^{2+}, Ba^{2+}$$)
  * $$S^{2-}, CO_3^{2-}, PO_4^{3-}, CrO_4^{2-}$$ (exception: $$Na^+, K^+, Li^+, NH_4^+$$)

#### Dissolve

* Water is a polar solvent that dissolves many ionic and polar substances
* Electrolytes: a substance that produces ions in solution when dissolved in water
  * Strong electrolyte: 100% dissociated to produce separate ions; strongly conducts an electric current; example: $$HClO_4$$
  * Weak electrolyte: Only a small percentage of dissolved molecules produce ions; weakly conducts an electric current; example: $$NH_3$$
  * Nonelectrolyte: Dissolved substance produces no ions; does not conduct an electric current; example: $$C_6H_{12}O_6$$

#### Molarity

$$Molarity (M) = \frac{molesOfSolute(mole)}{volumeOfSolution(L)}$$

example: 0.25 moles of $$NaCl$$ in 300 ml of solution -> M = 0.25/0.3 = 0.83

#### Dilution

* Explanation: Moles of solute after dilution = moles of solute before dilution: $$M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$$
* Example: Let's say you have a solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) with an initial concentration of 0.5 M and a volume of 1 liter. You want to dilute this solution to a final concentration of 0.1 M.
  * To calculate the volume of the diluted solution needed, you can use the formula M1V1 = M2V2. Rearranging the formula to solve for V2, we get: $$V2 = (M1V1) / M2$$. We get: $$V2 = (0.5 M x 1 L) / 0.1 M$$ => $$V2 = 5 L$$
  * So, to dilute the 0.5 M HCl solution to a final concentration of 0.1 M, you need to add 4 liters of water to the original 1 liter of solution, resulting in a total volume of 5 liters. The number of moles of HCl before and after the dilution will be the same, but the final solution will have a lower concentration of HCl per unit of volume due to the addition of more solvent (water).

#### equations

For example, when mixing $$K_2CrO_4$$ and $$Ba(NO_3)_2$$, a reaction to form $$BaCrO_4$$ and dissolve $$KNO_3$$ occurs

* formula equation: $$K_2CrO_4(aq) + Ba(NO_3)_2(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s) + 2KNO_3(aq)$$
* complete ionic equation: $$2K^+(aq) + CrO_4^{2-}(aq) + Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2(NO_3)^-(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s) + 2K^+(aq) + 2NO_3^-(aq)$$
* net ionic equation: $$Ba^{2+}(aq) + CrO_4^{2-}(aq) -> BaCrO_4(s)$$
* aq means: "aq" is used as an abbreviation for "aqueous", which means that a substance is dissolved in **water**
* s means: In chemistry, "s" is used as an abbreviation for "solid". It is often used in chemical equations to indicate that a substance is in the solid state

### Precipitation reactions

Precipitation reactions: dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products

formation of a solid occurs

example: $$AgNO_3(aqueous) + KCl(aqueous) — AgCl(precipitate) + KNO_3(aqueous)$$

### Acid–base reactions

Acid–base reactions: chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base

It involves a transfer of $$H^+$$ ions

Three model: Arrhenius ⊆ Brønsted–Lowry ⊆ Lewis

* Arrhenius
  * Acid: produces $$H^+$$
  * Base: produces $$OH^-$$
* Brønsted–Lowry
  * Acid: proton donor
  * Base: proton acceptor
  * proton = $$H^+$$
* Lewis
  * TBC

#### Titrations

* To calculate the concentration of the solution
* For example, given 20 ml of $$HCl$$ in a bottle, we gradually add $$NaOH$$ and after 48.6 ml of $$NaOH$$ added, the indicator changed color
  * equation: $$HCl + NaOH - H_2O + NaCl$$
  * [$$NaOH$$] = 0.100 M -> we need 0.00486 mol of $$NaOH$$
  * By the equation, mol of $$HCl$$ : mol of $$NaOH$$ = 1 : 1 -> there is also 0.00486 mole of $$Hcl$$ in the 20 ml bottle
  * [$$$HCl$] = 0.00486 / 0.02 = 0.243 M

### Oxidation–reduction reactions

Oxidation–reduction reactions: reaction causes the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron

It involves electron transfer

* Oxidation: loss electrons
* Reduction: gain electrons
* oxidation states method (TBC)

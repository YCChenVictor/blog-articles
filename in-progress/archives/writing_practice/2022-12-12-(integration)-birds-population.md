Birds population

---

Both the article and the lecture discuss whether the growth of human population and the corresponding increase in agriculture and pesticide use harm the birds. The reading material implies that it is true; however, the professor strongly oppose the article.

First of all, the passage mentions that the increase of human population decreases the natural habitats of birds, causing birds' population decreases. Nevertheless, the lecturer argues that some species of birds actually benefit from the urban area such as pigeons and seagull.

Secondly, the reading indicates that the increase of agricultural activities costs wilderness area, causing less living area for birds. Yet, the speaker proposed that there are less and less land being used for agriculture because of the advancement of technologies and new corps are developed.

Last but not the least, the reading passage suggests that the pesticides will inevitably get into the water and food chain and harm the birds. Once again, the scholar contradicts this idea by putting forward that there will be new and less harmful pesticides and pesticides-resisted corps in the future, which will cause less harm to the birds.

In conclusion, the professor opposes all the points in the passage. That is, the professor thinks the bird population will not necessarily decline.

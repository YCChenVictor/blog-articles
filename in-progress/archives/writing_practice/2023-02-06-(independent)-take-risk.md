Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well.

---

People often have different perspective on whether to take risks to be successful. Based on my past experience, I believe that people should try new things to get a successful results.

Firstly, I am a curious person and I always want to learn more things and try to use those knowledges to build new things. For example, I wrote a simple program and saved aroudn 50% processing time of a daily task when I was a financial analyst in a big company. Because of this program, I had a better career.

Secondly, I actually like to take risks. To be more specific, I had founded a company with my friends and we actually make good impact on shrimp industry with advanced technology. Not only I contributed to economy growth but I get a big fortune with it.

Thirdly, I really like to learn new things and I can combine these new knowledges with past experiences to inspire myself for building new adventures. That is to say, I am now building a software application with blockchain technology and wish I can give positive impact to the world.

In conclusion, given my curious personality, willingness to take risk and eagerness to learn, I believe that people should not only do what they know how to do well. We should all try new things and take risks to gain a sucessful results.

Preserve Torreya taxifoha

---

Both the article and lecturer comment on the preservation of a kind of tree, called Torreya taxifoha. The article proposes three possible solutions towards preservation but the speaker strongly disagrees them.

Firstly, the reading material mentions reestablish this species in the same location where some small areas have a better microclimate for them to thrive. However, the professor decline this solution with macroclimate must affect microclimate. As a result, during the climate changes, these trees will not survive.

Secondly, the passage proposes we can move these tree to the north places where there are cooler. Nevertheless, the lecturer rejects this idea because this movement will affect the creatures living there. To eb more specific, this three will spread a lot, so it will kill other planets.

At last, the teacher argues that the method, protecting these tree in research center, is also useless because the tree themselves need diversity. That is to say, the area of the research center is too small for these tree to have enough population, causing them do not have enough members to fight the disease.

In conclusion, the lecturer rejects all the possible solutions from this article. We may still try to find a better solution for saving these trees.

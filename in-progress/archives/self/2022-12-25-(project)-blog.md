## Introduction

TBC

## Why?

I need to structure my thoughts.

## How?

* Add an appendix directory to store the examples in each article
* I think the node graph need to have colors as grouped
* You should have session to expire JWT
* Because I there is going to be other mechanism, I need devise
* Actually, I can try to use rails to build backend, since blog is static sites with not that much UI/UX requirements
* Start to build backend and connect ChatGPT API
* Remember to move the chords and lyrics to blog
* The what section must have practical experience I had; for example, the result I get and the application I make
* In `_posts`, `find . -type f -exec stat -f '%m %N' {} + | sort | head -n 10`
* Use pomodoros, 25 mins on each article
* I will learn medical at my 35
* I should try to read those less read articles and try to refine them and should keep developing apps
* As you aware that you are doing some useless articles, I think you should try to synthesize two categories. That is, try to combine two big direction sections with two nodes and work on it and try to reduce unnecessary articles
* All the intro on each article should be done after the context is done
* Learn the FFT in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4
* music, I can make video of the song 家，before audio and after audio and write an article and connect the youtube video on my blog
* add static vs dynamic programming
* rename all the overview article to the directory name, so that the graph can show the name instead of overview
* connect code pan API, which means I can create code result on a defined area
* organize the css style to main.css
* Try to start from self/overview
* better href style
* migrate to react (jekyll has no update since 2019)
* solve all the warnings on webpack
* read fashion trends in aesthetics
* re-design in minimalist way
* have a better table CSS
* all articles should be as independent as possible
* split complexity and problem solving

* ask GPT the most common leetcode questions for all data structures
* add plotly and P5
* add react sketch https://codesandbox.io/s/charity-chat-canvas-sw4jy?file=/src/index.js()
* complete cracking coding interview first
* the overview article will be the core of each section and connect the groups of dots as network
* add dots plot for articles (mind map)
* add searching bar
* Increase the padding of each sentence (CSS)
* let sidebar be expendable (or I should try to know other's design)
* split articles according to modules of projects
* add dots plot for articles (mind map)
* move to react
* add a stylish title image (generate by AI)
* make landing api looks like openai, with capybara image as helper image and the art (branch: update-landing-page) drawing as background
* move image to about section
* solve <meta name="viewport"
* connect linkedin API
* add landing page for it
* add animation on landing page

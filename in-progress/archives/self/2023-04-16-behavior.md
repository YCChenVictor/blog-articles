# Title

## Introduction

Human behavior refers to the range of actions, reactions, and patterns of relating that humans exhibit in response to their environment, themselves, and others. It is shaped by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors.

## Why?

Understanding human behavior can help us to develop better relationships with others, improve our communication skills, and build more effective teams and organizations. It can also help us to address societal issues such as poverty, crime, and inequality, by providing insights into the root causes of these problems. Additionally, studying human behavior can lead to advances in fields such as psychology, sociology, and neuroscience, and contribute to the development of new therapies and treatments for mental and physical health disorders.

## How?

### Psychology

Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes. It seeks to understand how individuals think, feel, and behave in various situations, as well as the underlying psychological processes that drive behavior.

### Sociology

Sociology is the study of human society and social behavior. It seeks to understand how social structures, institutions, and norms influence individual behavior, as well as how individuals shape and are shaped by larger social forces.

### Anthropology

Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures. It seeks to understand how cultural norms, beliefs, and values shape individual behavior, as well as how individuals navigate and respond to different cultural contexts.

### Economics

Economics is the study of how people make choices in a world where resources are limited. It involves analyzing the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services to better understand how to allocate resources to maximize societal welfare.

### Neuroscience

Neuroscience is the study of the brain and nervous system. It seeks to understand how brain activity and neurochemical processes relate to human behavior, as well as how brain development and plasticity can be shaped by environmental factors.

* Behavioral neuroscience: the study of the relationship between the brain and behavior, including how the brain controls movement, perception, and emotion.
* Cellular neuroscience: the study of the structure and function of individual neurons, including their morphology, physiology, and molecular biology.
* Cognitive neuroscience: the study of how the brain processes and represents information, including perception, attention, memory, and language.
* Computational neuroscience: the use of mathematical and computer models to simulate and understand the function of the brain and nervous system.
  * Single neuron models: These models describe the behavior of individual neurons, including how they receive and transmit signals, and how they respond to different stimuli.
  * Network models: These models describe how groups of neurons interact with each other to process information and produce behavior. They can be used to simulate neural circuits involved in tasks such as vision, hearing, and movement.
  * Artificial neural networks: These models are designed to mimic the behavior of biological neural networks, and are used in machine learning and other applications. They can be trained to recognize patterns, make predictions, or control robotic systems.
    * Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Deep Learning: This is the most well-known area of computational neuroscience for software engineers. Topics could include how ANNs are structured, how they work, different types of ANNs, and how they are used in practical applications.
    * Neuronal Modeling: This area involves creating mathematical models of individual neurons and networks of neurons. Topics could include Hodgkin-Huxley models, integrate-and-fire models, spiking neural networks, and more.
    * Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): BCIs allow direct communication between the brain and computer systems. Topics could include different types of BCIs, the challenges of building effective BCIs, and how BCIs are used in practical applications.
    * Neuroimaging: This area involves using advanced imaging techniques, such as MRI and PET scans, to visualize the structure and function of the brain. Topics could include image processing techniques, machine learning approaches for analyzing neuroimaging data, and how neuroimaging is used to study brain function and dysfunction.
    * Cognitive Neuroscience: This area involves using computational models to understand how the brain processes information and gives rise to cognition and behavior. Topics could include models of attention, memory, language, decision-making, and more.
    * Neuromorphic Engineering: Neuromorphic engineering involves designing computer hardware and software that is inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. Topics could include how neuromorphic hardware is designed, how neuromorphic systems are programmed, and how neuromorphic engineering is used in practical applications.
* Developmental neuroscience: the study of how the brain and nervous system develop over time, from embryonic stages through childhood and into adulthood.
* Neuroimaging: the use of advanced imaging techniques, such as MRI and PET scans, to visualize the structure and function of the brain.
* Neuropsychology: the study of the relationship between brain function and behavior, particularly in patients with neurological disorders or injuries.

## What?

### Image and Speech Recognition

ANNs are commonly used in image and speech recognition systems, such as those used by virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. These systems use ANNs to analyze and classify input data, such as speech or images, and generate appropriate responses.

### Autonomous Vehicles

ANNs are an important part of autonomous vehicle systems, where they are used to process sensor data, such as images and lidar readings, and make decisions about steering, acceleration, and braking. ANNs can also be used for object detection and tracking, which is critical for ensuring the safety of passengers and other road users.

### Fraud Detection

ANNs can be used in fraud detection systems to analyze patterns and detect anomalies in financial data. These systems can be used to identify potentially fraudulent transactions and alert financial institutions to take appropriate action.

### Medical Diagnosis

ANNs are increasingly being used in medical diagnosis, where they can help identify patterns and classify data from medical images and other sources. For example, ANNs have been used to detect early signs of breast cancer from mammograms, and to analyze EEG data to diagnose neurological disorders.

### Natural Language Processing

ANNs are used in natural language processing systems, such as chatbots and translation software. These systems use ANNs to understand and generate natural language, and to generate appropriate responses to user input.

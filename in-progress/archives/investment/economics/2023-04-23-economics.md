The study of how individuals, organizations, and societies allocate scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants and needs
* Incentives: By understanding the incentives that drive behavior, it is possible to predict how individuals will respond to different situations. For example, by offering financial incentives, it may be possible to encourage people to engage in certain behaviors, such as exercising more or quitting smoking.

* Rationality: Traditional economics assumes that individuals are rational, meaning they make decisions based on a careful consideration of costs and benefits. However, behavioral economics recognizes that individuals may not always be perfectly rational, and may be subject to cognitive biases and other limitations. By understanding these biases, it may be possible to design policies and interventions that account for them.
* Externalities: Economics recognizes that individual behavior can have external effects on others, such as pollution or congestion. By understanding these externalities, it may be possible to design policies that encourage behavior that is beneficial to society as a whole.
* Social norms: Economics recognizes that social norms can play a powerful role in shaping behavior. By understanding the social norms that underlie certain behaviors, it may be possible to design interventions that change those norms and encourage more positive behaviors.

# Title

## Introduction

In behavioral economics, rationality is defined as making choices that are consistent with preferences and values, having a clear set of coherent beliefs, and being adaptable to new information and circumstances. This broader definition of rationality acknowledges that decision-making can be influenced by cognitive and emotional biases.

## Why?

Studying rationality in behavioral economics provides insights into how people make decisions, leading to more effective policies, products, and services that better meet individual and societal needs.

## How?

In traditional economics, rationality is often defined as the ability to make consistent choices that maximize one's utility or happiness. However, behavioral economists have challenged this assumption by showing that people often behave in ways that are inconsistent with traditional notions of rationality.

In behavioral economics, rationality is defined in a broader sense, which takes into account the cognitive and emotional biases that can influence decision-making. Rather than assuming that people always make choices based on rational calculations of costs and benefits, behavioral economists recognize that decision-making can be influenced by factors such as emotions, social norms, and cognitive limitations.

To be more specific, rationality in behavioral economics involves three main elements:
* Consistency: People should make choices that are consistent with their preferences and values. In other words, they should not choose options that they know will make them worse off.
* Coherence: People should have a clear and coherent set of preferences and beliefs that guide their decision-making. For example, they should not hold contradictory beliefs or preferences.
* Adaptability: People should be able to adjust their choices based on new information and changing circumstances. They should be able to learn from their mistakes and make better decisions in the future.

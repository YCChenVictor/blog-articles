## Introduction

* Childhood trauma: Experiences of abuse, neglect, or other adverse experiences that occur during childhood
* Long-term effects on an individual's mental health: Research has shown that childhood trauma can lead to a range of negative outcomes in adulthood, including mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidal behavior.
* These effects can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the severity of the trauma, the individual's age at the time of the trauma, the length of time the trauma occurred, and the availability of supportive relationships and resources.

## Why?

We can better identify and address the needs of those who have experienced trauma, and develop effective interventions to support their recovery.

## How?

### Results from childhood trauma

* Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Childhood trauma can lead to the development of PTSD in adulthood, which is characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and intense feelings of fear and anxiety.
* Depression: Individuals who have experienced childhood trauma may be more susceptible to developing depression in adulthood. This may be due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors.
* Anxiety disorders: Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, are also common among adults who have experienced childhood trauma. This may be due to a heightened sense of fear and anxiety, as well as a lack of coping skills.
* Substance abuse: Childhood trauma can increase the risk of substance abuse in adulthood, as individuals may turn to drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with their emotions and feelings of distress.
* Borderline personality disorder (BPD): Childhood trauma has been linked to the development of BPD, which is characterized by unstable moods, relationships, and self-image.
* Self-harm and suicidal behavior: Individuals who have experienced childhood trauma may be more likely to engage in self-harm or suicidal behavior in adulthood, as a way to cope with their emotions and feelings of distress.

### Parenting styles
  
* Authoritative
  * High levels of warmth and support, combined with moderate levels of control and discipline
  * Gold standard of parenting
  * Associated with positive outcomes for children in multiple areas of development
  * Tend to be responsive to their child's emotional needs, communicate openly and honestly with their child, and set clear expectations and boundaries for behavior
  * They provide guidance and support, but also allow their child to make decisions and learn from their mistakes
  * They use positive reinforcement to reward good behavior and may also use consequences or punishments for misbehavior, but they do so in a calm and consistent manner
* authoritarian (my parents)
  * High levels of control and discipline, combined with low levels of warmth and support. This parenting style is often described as strict, rigid, and demanding.
  * Be less responsive to their child's emotional needs and less likely to communicate openly and honestly with their child. They often expect unquestioned obedience from their child and may use physical punishment or verbal abuse to enforce their rules.
* permissive
  * Characterized by low levels of control and discipline, combined with high levels of warmth and support. This parenting style is often described as lenient, indulgent, or laissez-faire.
  * Permissive parents tend to have few rules and regulations for their children's behavior and may be reluctant to enforce consequences or discipline for misbehavior. They often provide a lot of emotional support and warmth to their children but may struggle to set limits or boundaries. Permissive parents may avoid conflict with their child and may be less likely to demand obedience or responsibility from their child.
* uninvolved
  * Neglectful parenting, is a parenting style that is characterized by low levels of both control and support. This parenting style is often described as neglectful, indifferent, or detached
  * Be emotionally distant from their children and may provide little to no support, guidance, or involvement in their child's life. They may neglect their child's basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter, and may show little interest in their child's activities or well-being. Uninvolved parents may be dealing with personal issues such as mental illness, substance abuse, or poverty, that make it difficult for them to provide adequate care and attention to their children.

### Developmental stages

* Authoritative parenting: Children of authoritative parents tend to have higher self-esteem, better emotional regulation, and higher academic achievement. They also tend to be more socially competent and have better relationships with their peers. These effects are seen **across various stages of child development**.
* Authoritarian parenting: Children of authoritarian parents tend to have lower self-esteem, poorer emotional regulation, and lower academic achievement. They may also exhibit more aggressive behavior and have lower levels of social competence. These effects may be particularly pronounced in **early childhood**.
* Permissive parenting: Children of permissive parents may have higher self-esteem and be more creative and independent, but they may also struggle with impulse control, have difficulty following rules, and exhibit more problem behaviors. These effects may be more prominent in **adolescence**.
* Uninvolved parenting: Children of uninvolved parents tend to have lower self-esteem, poorer emotional regulation, and lower academic achievement. They may also exhibit more behavior problems and have lower levels of social competence. These effects may be seen **across various stages of child development**, but may be particularly pronounced in early childhood.

### Implications

* Supporting parents: By understanding the effects of parenting styles, professionals can help parents become more effective in their parenting. For example, parents who are authoritarian might benefit from learning more about authoritative parenting strategies that are more effective in promoting positive child outcomes.
* Developing interventions: Knowledge of the effects of different parenting styles can be used to develop interventions aimed at improving parenting practices and promoting positive child outcomes. For example, interventions that focus on teaching parents how to use positive parenting strategies such as positive reinforcement, setting clear limits and expectations, and encouraging autonomy and independence can improve child outcomes.
* Promoting public awareness: Public awareness campaigns can be developed to increase awareness about the importance of parenting style in child development. This can help parents to recognize the importance of adopting more effective parenting practices and seeking support when needed.
* Informing policy: Knowledge of the effects of parenting styles on child development can inform policy decisions related to child welfare, family support, and education. For example, policies that promote positive parenting practices and provide support to parents can lead to better outcomes for children and families.

### Paper conclusions

* Effects of authoritative parental control on child behavior
  * Author: Baumrind, D. (1966)
  * Journal: Child Development, 37(4), 887-907
  * Summary: This influential paper by Diana Baumrind introduced the concept of parenting styles and proposed a typology based on two dimensions: parental responsiveness (warmth, support, and acceptance) and parental demandingness (control, structure, and discipline). Baumrind argued that authoritative parenting, which combines high levels of responsiveness and demandingness, is the most effective parenting style for promoting positive child outcomes, such as high self-esteem, self-reliance, and academic achievement. The paper is based on a series of studies that involved observing parent-child interactions and assessing child behavior.

  * Summary: This comprehensive review paper by Eleanor Maccoby and John Martin provides a broad overview of research on parent-child interaction and its role in child socialization. The paper covers a range of topics, including the effects of different parenting styles on child outcomes, the role of parent gender and culture in parenting, and the processes involved in socialization. The authors argue that parenting styles are an important factor in shaping child behavior and development, but that the effects of parenting are complex and depend on a range of factors, such as child temperament, family context, and cultural values.

## What?

* Parent education programs: Parent education programs can be developed and implemented to help parents understand the different parenting styles and the effects they can have on child development. These programs can provide parents with strategies and techniques for promoting positive outcomes in their children, regardless of their parenting style.
* Family support services: Family support services can be developed and implemented to provide families with the resources they need to promote positive child outcomes. These services can include counseling, parenting classes, home visits, and other types of support that can help families improve their parenting practices.
* School-based interventions: Interventions can be developed and implemented in schools to promote positive parenting practices and support child development. For example, schools can offer parent-teacher conferences, workshops on positive parenting, and other types of support to help parents promote positive outcomes in their children.
* Policy changes: Policy changes can be implemented at the local, state, or national level to promote positive parenting practices and support child development. For example, policies can be developed that support parental leave, affordable child care, and other types of support that can help parents promote positive outcomes in their children.

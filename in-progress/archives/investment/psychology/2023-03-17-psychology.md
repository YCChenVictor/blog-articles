### Abnormal Psychology

* Application (Why)
  * Improve mental health and well-being
  * Address the social and cultural factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of mental health disorders
  * Reduce the stigma associated with mental illness
  * Promote greater understanding and acceptance of those who are affected by these conditions
* Process (How)
  * Study of mental health disorders and other forms of abnormal behavior
  * Examination of abnormal thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that deviate from what is considered normal or healthy, and the impact of these conditions on individuals, society, and culture
* Solution (What)
  * Assessment: Assess the individual's symptoms and identify the underlying causes of their condition. This may involve a comprehensive clinical interview, medical evaluations, and psychological tests.
  * Diagnosis: Make a formal diagnosis of the mental health disorder. This involves matching the individual's symptoms with the diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-5 or ICD-11.
  * Treatment planning: Develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the individual's specific needs and goals. This may involve a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and other forms of behavioral or cognitive interventions.
  * Treatment implementation: Implement the interventions outlined in the plan. This may involve regular therapy sessions, medication management, and other forms of treatment.
  * Monitoring and evaluation: Ensure that the interventions are effective and that the individual is making progress towards their goals.
  * Maintenance and follow-up: Once the individual's symptoms have improved and their mental health has stabilized, they will typically continue to receive ongoing care and support to maintain their progress and prevent relapse.

#### DSM-5 or ICD-11

* Identify Symptoms
  * Asking the individual questions about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to gain a better understanding of their symptoms and how they are impacting their daily life (I should go to see the doctor)
  * Psychological testing: Professionals may also use psychological tests to identify symptoms and assess the individual's mental health. These tests may include personality assessments, intelligence tests, and symptom-specific questionnaires. (I can find some resources)
    * Personality tests: These tests are designed to assess an individual's personality traits, characteristics, and tendencies. Examples of personality tests include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the NEO Personality Inventory.
      * No MMPI free online
      * [NEO Personality Inventory result]({{site.baseurl}}/psychology/2023/03/26/NEO-result.html) (testometrika)
    * Intelligence tests: These tests are designed to assess an individual's cognitive abilities and intellectual potential. Examples of intelligence tests include the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.
    * Neuropsychological tests: These tests are designed to assess an individual's cognitive function and neurological status. Examples of neuropsychological tests include the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery and the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery.
    * Projective tests: These tests are designed to explore an individual's unconscious thoughts, emotions, and conflicts. Examples of projective tests include the Rorschach Inkblot Test and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).
  * Observation: Professionals may observe the individual's behavior and interactions with others to identify symptoms. This may involve observing the individual in a clinical setting or in their natural environment, such as at home or at work.
  * Medical evaluation: In some cases, professionals may conduct a medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the individual's symptoms.
  * Collaboration with other healthcare providers: Professionals may collaborate with other healthcare providers, such as primary care physicians, to identify symptoms and assess the individual's mental health.
* Match the symptoms to the diagnostic criteria: Once the presenting symptoms have been identified, the next step is to match them to the diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-5 or ICD-11. This involves comparing the individual's symptoms to the criteria for each mental health disorder to determine the most appropriate diagnosis.
* Consider comorbidities: In some cases, an individual may present with symptoms that meet the criteria for multiple mental health disorders. It is important to consider comorbidities and choose the diagnosis that best fits the individual's symptoms and overall presentation.
* Verify the diagnosis: After identifying the most appropriate diagnosis, it is important to verify it through additional assessment and evaluation. This may involve further psychological testing, medical evaluations, or consultations with other healthcare providers.
* Develop a treatment plan: Once a diagnosis has been made, the treatment team will develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the individual's specific needs and goals. This may involve a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and other forms of behavioral or cognitive interventions.

#### Medications

* Antidepressants: Antidepressants are used to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and other mood disorders. They work by regulating the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.
  * It seems making the disorder worse
* Antipsychotics: Antipsychotics are used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They work by blocking the activity of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is often overactive in individuals with these disorders.
* Anxiolytics: Anxiolytics are used to treat anxiety disorders and panic disorders. They work by reducing the activity of the central nervous system, which can help alleviate feelings of anxiety and fear.
* Mood stabilizers: Mood stabilizers are used to treat bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. They work by regulating the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain.

#### Psychotherapy

A type of talk therapy that involves working with a mental health professional to help improve your mental health and well-being

* Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their mental health issues. It's commonly used to treat **anxiety and depression**.
* Psychodynamic therapy focuses on exploring unconscious thoughts and emotions that may be contributing to mental health issues. It's commonly used to treat personality **disorders** and other mental health issues.
* Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on improving interpersonal relationships and communication. It's commonly used to treat **depression and other mood disorders**.
* Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) combines cognitive-behavioral therapy with mindfulness and acceptance techniques. It's commonly used to treat borderline personality disorder and other mood disorders.
* Family therapy involves working with a mental health professional to improve communication and relationships within a family. It's commonly used to treat family conflict, substance abuse, and other mental health issues.
* Group therapy involves working with a mental health professional and other individuals who are experiencing similar mental health issues. It provides a supportive environment for individuals to share their experiences and learn coping skills.

##### Cognitive-behavioral therapy

Ok, I need this and the steps is as follow:

* Identify negative thoughts and beliefs: Start by becoming aware of any negative thoughts or beliefs that may be contributing to your mental health issues. Write them down and try to identify any patterns.
* Challenge negative thoughts: Once you've identified negative thoughts and beliefs, challenge them by asking yourself if they are based on fact or if there is evidence to support them. Consider alternative perspectives and try to reframe your thoughts in a more positive light.
* Set achievable goals: Identify specific, achievable goals that you can work towards to improve your mental health. Break these goals down into smaller, manageable steps.
* Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. These basic self-care practices can have a big impact on your mental health.
* Use positive self-talk: Practice positive self-talk by repeating affirmations or positive statements to yourself. This can help counteract negative thoughts and beliefs.
* Monitor your progress: Keep track of your progress towards your goals and celebrate your successes along the way. If you're struggling, don't hesitate to seek professional help.

##### Interpersonal therapy

to be continued

#### Regular Therapy Sessions

* Generally, therapy sessions are scheduled once a week, but it's not uncommon for sessions to be scheduled every other week or even monthly.
* During the first few sessions, you and your therapist will work together to create a treatment plan that outlines your goals and the frequency of sessions.
* If you need to miss a session, be sure to let your therapist know as soon as possible so that you can reschedule.
* Remember that therapy is a collaborative process between you and your therapist. If you're not seeing progress or don't feel comfortable with your therapist, it's important to speak up and discuss your concerns. Your therapist can work with you to adjust the treatment plan and make any necessary changes to improve your progress.

#### Subfields

* Subfields: mood disorders (such as depression and bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders (such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias), personality disorders (such as borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder), and psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia).
* Abnormal psychology also explores the factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of mental health disorders, including biological, environmental, and psychological factors. This field also examines the various treatments that are available for these conditions, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and other forms of behavioral and cognitive interventions.

### Real World Problem

#### toxic relationship

* Study of behavior and mental processes that deviate from what is considered normal or healthy
* Subfields
  * Personality psychology focuses on understanding the characteristics that shape an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, including those that may contribute to toxic behavior
  * Social psychology examines the influence of social context and relationships on behavior, which is important in understanding how toxic behavior can spread and affect others
  * Clinical psychology also plays a role, as it involves the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders that may contribute to toxic behavior.

### interest terminology

* Context Effect
  * Concept: The context in which a stimulus is presented can significantly affect how we perceive and evaluate it. It highlights the importance of considering the context in which information is presented and the potential biases that can arise from it.
  * Example: Imagine you are shown a gray square on a white background. Then, you are shown the same gray square on a black background. Even though the physical characteristics of the square have not changed, your perception of its brightness and color may be influenced by the background.
* Heuristics
  * Concept: Make decisions or solve problems quickly and efficiently, without necessarily relying on logical or analytical thinking. While heuristics can be useful in many situations, they can also lead to errors or biases if they are applied too rigidly or without careful consideration of the specific context.
  * Example
    * Availability heuristic: The tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples of similar events come to mind. For example, people might overestimate the risk of shark attacks because they are more memorable than other, more common risks like car accidents.
    * Representativeness heuristic: This is the tendency to make judgments about the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles other events we know about. For example, people might assume that someone who wears glasses and reads a lot must be a university professor, even if that's not the case.
    * Anchoring and adjustment heuristic: This is the tendency to use an initial value (the "anchor") as a starting point for estimating a quantity, and then adjusting that estimate based on additional information. For example, people might be more likely to pay a high price for a product if the seller starts with a very high initial price, even if that price is arbitrary.
    * Recognition heuristic: This is the tendency to judge the value or importance of something based on how familiar it is. For example, people might assume that a well-known brand is better than a lesser-known one, even if they have no other information.

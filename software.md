# (Self) Software

## Purpose

To acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to design, develop, and utilize digital tools and applications to solve problems and improve efficiency in various domains.

## Concept

Software is essentially a collection of instructions and data that dictates the actions and behavior of a computer system. These instructions, typically written in a programming language, outline the steps the computer should follow to perform specific tasks, while the data provides the necessary information for these tasks to be executed. Together, they serve as the guiding force behind the computer's operations, enabling it to process information, run applications, and interact with users or other systems. In essence, software acts as the bridge between users and the hardware components of a computer, translating human-readable commands and tasks into machine-executable instructions. Without software, computers would be inert machines devoid of functionality, incapable of carrying out the myriad tasks they are commonly used for in today's digital age.

### Fundamental Knowledge

#### Complexity

Complexity is a fundamental characteristic of systems, phenomena, and processes that exhibit intricate interconnections, dependencies, and behaviors. It involves the study and understanding of intricate patterns, emergent properties, and nonlinear dynamics, challenging traditional reductionist approaches and requiring holistic perspectives to unravel its multifaceted nature. For more information, please refer to [complexity](/blog/software/dsa/complexity).

#### Data Structures and Algorithms

[Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](/blog/software/dsa/main) are essential foundations in software development, providing the tools and techniques to organize and manipulate data efficiently, optimize code performance, and solve complex problems in a systematic and scalable manner. Mastery of DSA enables developers to design robust software solutions, improve algorithmic efficiency, and create optimized code for various applications and domains.

#### System Design

System design involves creating a blueprint for the structure and organization of a software system, considering factors such as architecture, modules, interfaces, and data flow. It aims to transform requirements into an efficient and scalable solution that meets the desired goals and objectives of the system. For more information, please refer to [system design](/blog/software/system-design/main).

#### Programming Style

* Object-oriented design is a fundamental aspect of software development, emphasizing the creation of elegant and maintainable code through the organization of classes and methods to solve problems or represent real-life entities. By applying object-oriented principles, developers can achieve modularity, reusability, and improved quality in their software systems. For more information, please refer to [object oriented design](/blog/software/ood/main).
* [Functional Programming]

#### Refactor

Refactoring is the process of improving code quality and structure without changing its external behavior, essential for enhancing software maintainability and reducing technical debt. It involves making small, incremental changes to optimize code, making it easier to understand and extend. For more information, please refer to [refactor]().

#### API

[API]

#### Cache

[Cache]

#### Test Concept

[testing]

### System software

This type of software is designed to manage and control the hardware and software resources of a computer system. Examples include operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as device drivers and utility programs like antivirus software and disk management tools. For more information, please refer to [operating systems](/blog/software/os/main).

### Web Application software

This type of software is designed for specific tasks or applications, such as word processing, spreadsheet creation, email management, and graphic design. Examples include Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and Google Chrome.

#### Internet

#### Plan and Design

Plan and design the user interface and functionality of your web application.

* Server-side rendering
  * Advantage: Efficient search engine indexing, better performance on low-powered devices, and improved accessibility.
  * Concept: Generates the HTML content on the server and sending it to the client's web browser for display.
  * Example: Rails
* Client-side rendering with a separation of concerns
  * Advantage: This approach offers a more interactive and responsive user experience since the client can manipulate the DOM and fetch data asynchronously without full page reloads.
  * Concept: The frontend is the user-facing part of an application responsible for displaying and interacting with the interface, the backend handles data processing and logic, and Token-based authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure secure data transmission between the frontend and backend by utilizing tokens as digital credentials for validating user identity and permissions.
  * Example: React + Node

#### Frontend

* Framework: [React](/blog/software/react/main), [Vue]
* Resource: Resources encompass all the elements and assets utilized by a web application, including JavaScript code, HTML elements, CSS styles, images, fonts, data structures, external libraries, storage mechanisms, caching, browser tabs, event handlers, and dynamic content. Efficient management of resources is essential for optimizing frontend memory usage and enhancing the performance and stability of web applications.

#### Backend

* Framework: [Express], or [Ruby on Rails]
* [Database](/blog/software/database/main)
* [backend tests](/blog/software/database/backend-tests)

#### Package Managers

* Javascript: [Npm], [Yarn]
* Ruby: [Gem]

#### Deploy and Maintain

* [Deploy] your web application to a web server
* Maintain it by regularly updating it with bug fixes and [security] patches
* [scale up] the application to handle increased traffic or integrating it with other systems.
* [Quality Assurance]

### Embedded software

This type of software is designed to control and manage hardware devices and systems, and is often built into the devices themselves. Examples include the software that controls a car's engine, a digital camera's image processing, or a smart thermostat's temperature control.

* [Robotic]

### Mobile Applications

Includes iOS and Android apps, which have unique characteristics and development considerations.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)

Encompasses software that uses AI and ML algorithms for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

### Internet of Things (IoT)

Involves software that controls and communicates with connected devices in the IoT ecosystem.

### Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)

Encompasses software that creates immersive experiences, often used in gaming, training, or simulations.

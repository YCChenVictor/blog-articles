# Web Development

## Purpose

To help me develop good websites.

## Concept

### Fundamental Knowledge

* [complexity](/concept/complexity)
* [Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](concept/data-structure-and-algorithm)
* [system design](concept/system-design)
* Programming Style
  * [object oriented design](concept/ood)
* [operating systems](concept/operating-system)
* [internet](/concept/internet)

### Plan and Design

Plan and design the user interface and functionality of your web application.

* Server-side rendering
  * Advantage: Efficient search engine indexing, better performance on low-powered devices, and improved accessibility.
  * Concept: Generates the HTML content on the server and sending it to the client's web browser for display.
  * Example: Rails
* Client-side rendering with a separation of concerns
  * Advantage: This approach offers a more interactive and responsive user experience since the client can manipulate the DOM and fetch data asynchronously without full page reloads.
  * Concept: The frontend is the user-facing part of an application responsible for displaying and interacting with the interface, the backend handles data processing and logic, and Token-based authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure secure data transmission between the frontend and backend by utilizing tokens as digital credentials for validating user identity and permissions.
  * Example: React + Node

### Frontend

* Framework: [React], [Vue]
* Resource: Resources encompass all the elements and assets utilized by a web application, including JavaScript code, HTML elements, CSS styles, images, fonts, data structures, external libraries, storage mechanisms, caching, browser tabs, event handlers, and dynamic content. Efficient management of resources is essential for optimizing frontend memory usage and enhancing the performance and stability of web applications.

### Backend

* Framework: [Express], or [Ruby on Rails]
* [Database]
* [backend tests]

### Package Managers

* Javascript: [Npm], [Yarn]
* Ruby: [Gem]

### Deploy and Maintain

* [Deploy] your web application to a web server
* Maintain it by regularly updating it with bug fixes and [security] patches
* [scale up] the application to handle increased traffic or integrating it with other systems.
* [Quality Assurance]

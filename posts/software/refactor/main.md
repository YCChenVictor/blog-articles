# Title

## Purpose

Refactoring is done to improve code quality and maintainability, making it easier to understand, modify, and add new features.

## Concept

Refactoring returns the following results:
* Improving Code Maintainability: Refactoring makes code easier to understand and modify, reducing the time and effort required for maintenance and future development.
* Enhancing Code Quality: Refactoring helps eliminate code smells, reduce technical debt, and improve overall code quality, resulting in fewer bugs and better reliability.
* Facilitating Future Development: Refactored code is more adaptable and extensible, allowing for the seamless addition of new features and improvements to the software.

### Ways

* Coding Standard
  * Build Expressiveness: good naming, good structure ... etc
  * Compose code to do 'one thing' well, as less dependent as possible; follow SOLID
  * Use data structure
  * Use design pattern
* Code Reviews: Regular code reviews by peers can identify issues, improve coding standards, and share knowledge.
* Static Code Analysis Tools: Tools like ESLint (for JavaScript), Pylint (for Python), and SonarQube can automatically analyze code for issues, coding style violations, and security vulnerabilities.
* Unit Testing: Ensure comprehensive unit test coverage to catch bugs and ensure code behaves as expected.
* Code Metrics: Use metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, and maintainability index to assess code quality objectively.
  * How are the metrics calculated
* Code Smells: Identify common code smells, such as duplication, long methods, and excessive coupling, using tools like SonarQube or manual inspection.
* Performance Testing: Test the code for performance bottlenecks and optimize as needed.
* User Feedback: Gather feedback from end-users to identify usability and functionality issues.
* Documentation: Ensure code is well-documented, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
* Maintainability: Evaluate code's readability, modularity, and adherence to coding standards.
* Security Scans: Use security scanning tools to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
* Code Review Checklists: Create and follow checklists for code reviews to cover common issues and best practices.
* Automated CI/CD Pipelines: Incorporate code quality checks into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early and enforce quality standards.

### Coding Standard

#### Naming

1. Use Intention-Revealing Names
2. Avoid Disinformation
3. Make Meaningful Distinctions

### Code Review

TBC

### write code with test

We should write down all the possible cases in our test.

### Code Maintainability

TBC

### Code Duplication

Refactoring helps eliminate duplicated code, reducing maintenance efforts and the risk of introducing bugs.

* ESLint with eslint-plugin-react
  * Install
    ```bash
    npm install eslint eslint-plugin-react --save-dev
    ```
  * Configure (in ./eslintrc.js)
    ```js
    // .eslintrc.js
    module.exports = {
      plugins: ['react'],
      extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'plugin:react/recommended'],
      rules: {
        // Define rules specific to React and code quality here
      },
    };
    ```
  * run
    ```bash
    npx eslint src/
    ```

### Scalability

Refactoring prepares code for future enhancements by breaking it into modular components that can be extended or modified more easily.

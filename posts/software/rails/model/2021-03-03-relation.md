## How

### Types of Associations

Rails provides several types of associations to represent different relationships between models, such as belongs_to, has_many, has_one, and has_and_belongs_to_many. It's crucial to grasp the purpose and usage of each association type to establish correct and efficient relationships between models.

* belongs_to: Used to define a one-to-many relationship between two tables
* has_many: Used to define a one-to-many relationship between two tables
* has_one: Used to define a one-to-one relationship between two tables
* example: We have a User model, a Profile model, and a Post model. Each user has one profile, and each user can have many posts. Each post belongs to a user.

To define these associations,

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :profile
  has_many :posts
end

class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_one :profile, through: :user # because user has one profile and also has many posts
end
```

This tells Rails that each User has one Profile, and that each User can have many Posts. It also tells Rails that each Profile belongs to a User, and that each Post belongs to a User. By default, Rails assumes that the posts table has a foreign key called user_id that references the id column of the users table.

Access related data:

```ruby
@user = User.find(params[:id])
@profile = @user.profile

@user = User.find(params[:id])
@posts = @user.posts

@post = Post.find(params[:id])
@user = @post.user

@post = Post.find(params[:id])
@profile = @post.profile
```

### Declaring Associations

Associations are declared within Rails model classes using appropriate methods provided by ActiveRecord, the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer in Rails. By utilizing these methods, you can define the relationships between models and specify options like foreign keys, dependent actions, and eager loading behaviors.

### Querying and Manipulating Related Data

Once associations are set up, you can leverage them to query and manipulate related data effectively. Rails provides methods like includes, joins, and eager loading associations to optimize database queries and minimize the number of database hits. Additionally, understanding methods like build, create, and destroy helps in creating and managing related records conveniently.

## What

For example, if we want to build an online store system. The relations:

* One-to-one: every user can create one store
* One-to-many: a store can sell many products
* Many-to-many: Each store can sell many products and each product can be sold in many stores

### one-to-one

* Visualization
  <div class="mermaid">
  classDiagram
    direction LR
    class User{
      -id : int
      -name : string
      -email: string
      -tel: int
    }
    class Store{
      -id : int
      -title: string
      -address: string
      -tel: int
      -user_id: int
    }
    User "1" --o "1" Store : has_one
  </div>
* Generate `User` and `Store` model
  ```bash
  rails g model User name email tel
  rails g model Store title tel address user_id:integer
  # or
  rails g model Store title tel address user:references

  rails db:migrate
  ```
`user_id:integer` makes `Store` to have foreign key matching id in User database.

* Before setting relation in model, if we directly create `user` and `store` and build relation as follow:
  ```
  user1 = User.new(name: "aaa")
  store1 = Store.new(title: "aaa")
  user1.store = store1
  ```
  * Error
    ```
    NoMethodError (undefined method `store=' for #<User:0x00000001212dada8>)
    ```
,meaning the user does not have the method to set relation with store, setting relation up as follow
* Solve errors
  * In user model,
    ```
    class User < ApplicationRecord  
      has_one :store  
    end
    ```
  * In store model,
    ```
    class Store < ApplicationRecord  
      belongs_to :user  
    end
    ```
  * Then we can use model to manipulate database with model as follow
    ```
    user1.store = store1
    or
    store1.user = user1

    user1.save
    ```
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/1__4____gMZvS0GRwn01ADm__BGA.png" alt="">
    * As you can see, there are two `INSERT`. One for `user1` and one for `store1` because there is relation set up above.


### one-to-many

Let’s build Product model
```
$ rails g model Product name description:text price:decimal is_available:boolean store_id:integer
```
and
```
$ rails db:migrate
```
<img src="/assets/img/1__oP9w1ETe5aCdLpGVaHMuvw.png" alt="">

Then add the relation in model

In store model,
```
class Store < ApplicationRecord  
  belongs_to :user  
  has_many :products  
end
```
In product model
```
class Product < ApplicationRecord  
  belongs_to :store  
end
```
#### **Create products**
```
product1 = Product.new(name: "aaa", price: 100)  
product2 = Product.new(name: "bbb", price: 200)
```
#### **Appoint store**
```
store1 = Store.first
```
#### **move product into store**
```
store1.products = [product1, product2]
```

### scope in has_many
```
has_many :comments, -> { where(author_id: 1) }
```
Use lambda function to specify the scope of this has_many

### many-to-many

#### **Create WareHouse for the following relation**

##### app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_projects
  has_many :projects, through: :user_projects
end

##### app/models/project.rb
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_projects
  has_many :users, through: :user_projects
end

##### app/models/user_project.rb
class UserProject < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :project
end


#### HABTM (has_and_belongs_to_many)

To deal with many-to-many structure, there is another way to set the model. For example, we can rewrite store and product into

**Store**
```
class Store < ApplicationRecord  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :products  
end
```
**Product**
```
class Product < ApplicationRecord  
  has_and_belongs_to_many: stores  
end
```
Notice, because there is no command to specify the middle table, warehouse, by default, rails will looking for products_stores.

We can reset the above models and do migration again.
```
$ rails g migration create_join_table_for_store_and_product
```
With `HABTM`, there will be no `warehouse` model for us to do more model manipulation.

### Add Relations Explicitly

If we found that a model should have relation with another model and both models have been created,

#### add reference

For example, if we want to add reference to model, Post with model, User. Then,

```
$ rails g migration AddUserToPosts user:references
```

Rails will create
```
class AddUserToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]  
  def change  
    add_reference :posts, :user, null: false, foreign_key: true  
  end  
end
```
in `db/migrate`

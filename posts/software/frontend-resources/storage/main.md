## Concept

* LocalStorage: LocalStorage is a web storage API that allows web applications to store data persistently within the user's browser. Data stored in LocalStorage remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened. It is commonly used for storing small amounts of data, such as user preferences, session data, or application settings.
* SessionStorage: Similar to LocalStorage, SessionStorage is a web storage API that allows data to be stored within the user's browser. However, data stored in SessionStorage is only available for the duration of the browser session. Once the session ends (i.e., when the browser is closed), the data is cleared.
* Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on the user's device by the web browser. They are commonly used for various purposes, including session management, tracking user preferences, and maintaining user authentication state.
* IndexedDB: IndexedDB is a more powerful web storage API that allows web applications to store large amounts of structured data within the user's browser. It provides a more sophisticated storage solution compared to LocalStorage and SessionStorage, enabling applications to perform complex data queries and transactions.
* Cache Storage: Cache Storage is a browser storage mechanism used for storing cached responses to network requests made by the web application. It is commonly used to improve performance by caching resources such as JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and API responses.
* Web SQL Database: Although deprecated, Web SQL Database was a web storage API that allowed web applications to store structured data in a SQL database within the user's browser. It has been largely superseded by IndexedDB.

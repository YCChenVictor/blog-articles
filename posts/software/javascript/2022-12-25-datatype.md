## Introduction

TBC

## Why?

Learning JavaScript datatypes is crucial for understanding how values are stored and manipulated, enabling you to write more efficient and robust code.

## How?

Data types define the way to store values and pass them as parameters. The built-in data types as follow:

* primitive data types
  * number
  * string
  * boolean
  * undefined: absence of a value
  * null: deliberate non-value
  * symbol: represents a unique identifier
* reference data types
  * object: represents complex data types, such as arrays, functions, and objects
* NaN, which stands for "Not a Number" and is returned when a mathematical operation fails

Variables in JavaScript do not have to be declared with a specific data type, as the data type is determined dynamically at runtime. This means that a variable can hold different types of data at different points in the program.

To work with data more effectively and avoid errors in your code

* Type conversions: JavaScript automatically converts data types in some situations, such as when performing mathematical operations or comparing values. Understanding how these conversions work is important for avoiding unexpected results in your code.
* Variable declaration: In JavaScript, variables are dynamically typed, meaning their data type can change based on the value assigned to them. It's important to understand how variables are declared and initialized to avoid errors in your code.
* Data manipulation: Understanding data types is crucial for manipulating data effectively in your code. For example, you need to know how to concatenate strings, perform mathematical operations on numbers, and loop through arrays.
* Memory management: Different data types consume different amounts of memory in JavaScript, which can affect the performance of your program. It's important to be aware of how much memory your data types are using and to optimize your code accordingly.

### const vs let

* const is used to declare a variable that cannot be **reassigned** after its initial value is set, while let allows for reassignment.
* const variables must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration, whereas let variables can be initialized later.
* example

```javascript
const x = 5;
x = 10; // This will throw an error, because x is a const and cannot be reassigned.

let y;
y = 5;
y = 10; // This is allowed, because y is a let and can be reassigned.

if (true) {
  const z = 5;
  let w = 10;
  console.log(z); // This will output 5.
  console.log(w); // This will output 10.
}

console.log(z); // This will throw an error, because z is only accessible within the if block.
console.log(w); // This will also throw an error, because w is only accessible within the if block.
```

### Number

* Numeric literals:

```javascript
let x = 42;        // integer
let y = 3.14;      // floating-point number
let z = -10;       // negative integer
```

* Arithmetic operators:

```javascript
let a = 5 + 3;     // addition
let b = 10 - 4;    // subtraction
let c = 6 * 2;     // multiplication
let d = 8 / 2;     // division
let e = 15 % 4;    // modulus (returns the remainder after division)
```

* Math library:

```javascript
let f = Math.sqrt(16);      // square root of 16
let g = Math.floor(3.9);    // round down to nearest integer (returns 3)
let h = Math.random();      // generate a random number between 0 and 1
```

* NaN:

```javascript
let i = 0 / 0;     // NaN (not a number)
let j = "abc" / 2; // NaN (attempting to divide a string by a number)
```

* Infinity and -Infinity:

```javascript
let k = 1 / 0;     // Infinity
let l = -1 / 0;    // -Infinity
```

* Number object:

```javascript
let m = Number("42");           // convert a string to a number
let n = 42.3456.toFixed(2);     // round a number to 2 decimal places (returns "42.35")
let o = Number.MAX_VALUE;       // largest possible number in JavaScript
let p = Number.MIN_VALUE;       // smallest possible positive number in JavaScript
```

### string

* string with variable
  ```javascript
  `Hello, ${name}`
  ```
* substring
  ```javascript
  originalString.replace(substringToRemove, "")
  ```
* clean text
  ```javascript
  let text = "       Hello World!        ";
  let result = text.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/gm,'');
  ```
* Uppercase first letter
  ```javascript
  string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1)
  ```

### HTMLCollection

If you want to loop it

```javascript
Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName("events")).forEach(function(item) {
  console.log(item.id);
});
```

#### get text

```javascript
HTMLElement.innerText
```

### nodelist

TBC

### array

* fill array with a value
  ```javascript
  Array(5).fill(2)
  ```
* unique
  ```javascript
  Array.from(new Set(myArray))
  ```
* every
  ```javascript
  const myArray = [0, 0, 0, 0];
  const containsOnlyZeros = myArray.every(element => element === 0);
  ```
* first
* last
* merge two array
  ```javascript
  ```
* merge array of object
  ```javascript
  const arrayOfObjects = [
    { key1: "value1" },
    { key2: "value2" },
    { key3: "value3" }
  ];
  
  const mergedObject = arrayOfObjects.reduce((result, currentObj) => {
    return { ...result, ...currentObj };
  }, {});
  
  console.log(mergedObject);
  ```
* include?
  ```javascript
  const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const elementToCheck = 3;
  
  if (array.includes(elementToCheck)) {
    console.log("Element exists in the array.");
  } else {
    console.log("Element does not exist in the array.");
  }
  ```
* slice
  ```javascript
  const array = [5, 12, 18, 23, 27, 31, 42, 55, 63, 78];

  // Get elements from index 2 to index 5 (inclusive of 2, exclusive of 6)
  const rangeOfElements = array.slice(2, 6);
  console.log(rangeOfElements); // Output: [18, 23, 27, 31]
  ```
* concat
  ```javascript
  const array1 = [5, 12, 18];
  const array2 = [23, 27, 31];
  
  const combinedArray = array1.concat(array2);
  
  console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [5, 12, 18, 23, 27, 31]
  ```

### set

* Create set
  ```javascript
  const mySet1 = new Set();
  mySet1.add(1);
  console.log(mySet1)
  ```
* Read set
  ```javascript
  mySet1.has(1);
  ```
* Add lots of elements
  ```javascript
  const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
  const newElements = [4, 5, 6];
  mySet.add(...newElements);
  console.log(mySet); // Output: Set(6) { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
  ```
* Add duplicated data will not have duplicated element in the set

### map

Map allows you to store key-value pairs and quickly retrieve the value associated with a given key

#### example

```javascript
const myMap = new Map();
myMap.set('key1', 'value1');
myMap.set('key2', 'value2');

console.log(myMap.get('key1')); // Output: 'value1'
console.log(myMap.has('key2')); // Output: true
console.log(myMap.size); // Output: 2

myMap.delete('key1');
console.log(myMap.size); // Output: 1
```

#### map vs object

* Map can use any value, including objects, as keys, while an Object can only use strings and symbols as keys
* Map is an ordered list of key-value pairs, while an Object is not guaranteed to be ordered
* Common use cases for using a Map over an Object in JavaScript include:
  * When you need keys that are not strings or symbols: Maps allow any type of value to be used as keys, including objects, functions, and primitive values like numbers or boolean values.
  * When you need to maintain the insertion order of key-value pairs: Maps guarantee the order of key-value pairs, making them suitable for scenarios where the order of insertion matters.
  * When you need to easily iterate over key-value pairs: Maps provide built-in methods like forEach and entries for iterating over their elements, making them convenient for tasks like enumeration or processing all key-value pairs.
* On the other hand, common use cases for using an Object over a Map include:
  * When you primarily need string keys: Objects are optimized for use with string keys and are commonly used as dictionaries or associative arrays in JavaScript.
  * When you want to leverage object literals for concise syntax: Object literals offer a compact and familiar syntax for defining key-value pairs directly in code.
  * When performance is a concern for frequent key access: Objects tend to have better performance characteristics for frequent property access, especially when using string keys.

### undefined vs null

### object

* example
  ```javascript
  const object1 = {
    a: 'someString',
    b: 42,
    c: false
  };
  ```
* get keys
  ```javascript
  Object.keys(object1)
  ```
* get values
  ```javascript
  Object.values(object1)
  ```
* destructing
  ```javascript
  const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 30
  };
  //
  const { firstName, lastName, age } = person;
  //
  console.log(firstName); // Output: John
  console.log(lastName); // Output: Doe
  console.log(age); // Output: 30
  ```
* loop
  ```javascript
  items.forEach(item => {})
  ```
* check whether a value match an attributes: use `find` or `filter`; please refer to [methods]
* key as variable
  ```javascript
  const dynamicKey = "someKey";
  const dynamicValue = "someValue";
  
  // Method 1: Creating a new object with the dynamic key-value pair
  const newObjMethod1 = {
    [dynamicKey]: dynamicValue,
  };
  
  // Method 2: Adding the dynamic key-value pair to an existing object
  const existingObj = {
    existingKey: "existingValue",
  };
  
  existingObj[dynamicKey] = dynamicValue;
  
  console.log(newObjMethod1);
  console.log(existingObj);
  ```

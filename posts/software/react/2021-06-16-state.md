## Introduction

Based on the concepts of component and props in previous articles, you may find that there are issues related to state as follow:

* unchangeable state variables in component
* single source of truth
* lift states

## Why

## How

### unchangeable state variables in component

To solve it, the core concept is to copy the structure of the state in a `const` variable and re-render it with that state; for example,

turn the onClick method in button of delete in `<Counter>` into

```jsx
<button
  ...
  onClick={() => this.props.onDelete(this.props.id)}
>
  Delete
</button>
```

once clicked, it will pass `this.props.id` to the `onDelete` method in `<Counter>` of `<Counters>` and trigger `handleDelete` method, which is going to filter all the `id` in the `state`, which is not equal to the `id` passed by `this.props.id` and return the filtered state, `counters` and re-render

```jsx
handleDelete = counterId => {
  const counters = this.state.counters.filter(c => c.id !== counterId);
  this.setState({ counters });
}

render() {
  return (
    <div>
      {this.state.counters.map(counter =>
        <Counter
          ...
          id={counter.id}
        >
        </Counter>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then once you click the delete button, the row of counter will disappear.

Note that you can modify the `value={counter.value}` and `id={counter.id}` to `counter={counter}` and use these states in children component with `this.props.counter.id` and `this.props.counter.id`

### single source of truth

In 2021-06-15-react-component-and-prop.md, we know when a state changes, react change the virtual DOM first and then change the state of real DOM. Now we want to create a reset button to reset all the calculation in all the counters.

In `counters`,

```jsx
class Counters extends Component {
  ...
  handleReset = () => {
    const counters = this.state.counters.map(
      c => {
        c.value = 0;
        return c;
      }
    );
    this.setState({ counters });
    console.log(counters)
  }
  ...
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button
          className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
          onClick={() => this.handleReset()}
        >
          Reset
        </button>
        ...
      </div>
    );
  }
  ...
}
```

Once we click the reset button and trigger `handleReset` method, the `state` in `counters` changed and trigger the `render` method, then it will pass the new value as props to `counter`; however, because state can only be modified inner the component, the state in `counter` did not changed, which means the `counter` will not be re-rendered. What we need to do is to remove all the local state in `counter` and make the children `counter` to be controlled by the props passed by `counters` as follow:

from

```jsx
class Counter extends Component {
  state = {
    value: this.props.value,
  }

  handleIncrement = (product) => {
    this.setState({ value: this.state.value + 1 })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        ...
        <button
          className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
          onClick={() => this.handleIncrement({id:1})}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        ...
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

to

```jsx
class Counter extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        ...
        <button
          className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
          onClick={() => this.props.onIncrement(this.props.counter)}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        ...
      </div>
    );
  }
  ...
}
```

and add `handleIncrement` in `Counters`

```jsx
class Counters extends Component {
  ...
  handleIncrement = counter => {
    const counters = [...this.state.counters];
    const index = counters.indexOf(counter);
    counters[index] = { ...counter };
    counters[index].value++;
    this.setState({ counters });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        ...
        {this.state.counters.map(counter =>
          <Counter
            ...
            onIncrement={this.handleIncrement}
            ...
          >
            ...
          </Counter>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
  ...
}
```

### lift states

For example, we want to have a NavBar to show to total counts of the counters just like the tree in 2021-06-13-react-overview.md showed. Then we need to lift the state of counters to `App` and then pass state to `NavBar`

create `App` component as follow

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import NavBar from './components/navbar';
import Counters from './components/counters';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Navbar />
      <main className='container'>
        <Counter />
      </main>
    )
  }
}
```

and add `<Navbar />` as follow

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class NavBar extends Component {
  state = {}
  render() {
    return (
      <nav className=''>
        <a className='' href='#'>Navbar</a>
      </nav>
    );
  }
}

export default NavBar;
```

remember to add the tailwind structure

----

The key tools are `useContext` and `useReducer`.

A. `useContext`: letting the nested components to use variable defined in the components outside. For example, the nested structure: `ThemedButton()` in `Toolbar()` in `App()`. With `ThemeContext` created by `React.createContext()` outside these components, we can access ThemeContext

```javascript
const themes = {
  light: {
    foreground: "#000000",
    background: "#eeeeee"
  },
  dark: {
    foreground: "#ffffff",
    background: "#222222"
  }
};

const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={themes.dark}>
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.foreground }}>
      I am styled by theme context!
    </button>
  );
}
```

B. `useReducer`:

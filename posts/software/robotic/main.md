# Title

## Purpose

Learning robotics can provide the skills to design, build, and program robots for various applications, from manufacturing and healthcare to exploration and entertainment.

## Concept

Ok, let's build a robot first. A basic robot to build could be a simple wheeled robot with sensors that can move around and avoid obstacles.

### Steps

* Select Components: Choose wheels, motors, microcontrollers (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi), sensors (ultrasonic, infrared), and a power source.
* Design: Create a basic design or blueprint for your robot's structure and layout of components.
* Assembly: Assemble the chassis, attach motors and wheels, and connect the electronic components according to your design.
* Programming: Write code to control the motors, read sensor data, and implement the desired behavior (e.g., obstacle avoidance).
* Sensor Integration: Code the sensors to provide input for the robot's decision-making process.
* Testing: Test your robot's movement, sensor readings, and behavior in different scenarios.
* Refinement: Iterate on your design and code to improve performance and functionality.
* Troubleshooting: Debug any issues with movement, sensors, or code logic.
* Documentation: Keep notes on the design, components, and code changes for future reference.
* Expansion: Once you've mastered the basics, you can add more sensors, capabilities, or behaviors to your robot.
* Learn and Explore: Continuously learn about advanced robotics concepts and technologies to enhance your skills.

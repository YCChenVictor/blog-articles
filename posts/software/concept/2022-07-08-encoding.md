## Introduction

This article describes the concept of encodings

* 7 bit ASCII (encoding): basic 128 characters
* 8 bit encodings: extensions of 7 bit ASCII
* **Unicode** (character set): put every characters in the world in a sets
* UTF-8
* UTF-16
* UTF-32

## Why?

Given character sets, we need a way to tell computers which character to be used, so we need a character encoding standard for electronic communication such as ASCII.

## How?

### 7 bit ASCII

* ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange
* Why 7 bits? Computers were using 8 bits when ASCII invented, so these encodings must can be stored and had a whole bit to spare
* 7 bits -> 128 possible values ($$2^7$$) -> use numbers, 0 ~ 127, to represent characters
  * control characters (0 ~ 31): not printable and start particular action such that 7 makes computer to beep.
  * printable characters (32 ~ 127): printable characters such as `a`, `1`, `!`, ` `, ...etc

Please refer to appendix for full list of 7 bit ASCII

### 8 bit encodings

There are more languages other than English and we use following encodings to deal with them:

* 8 bit single byte (256)
  * Latin: EBCDIC
  * Western: ISO/IEC 8859, MS-Windows, MAC OS Roman
  * Russian related: KOI8, MIK
  * South Asian: ISCII, TSCII, VSCII
* 8 bit double byte (65536)
  * Japanese: JIS
  * Simplified Chinese: Guobiao
  * Traditional Chinese: Big5
  * Korean: KS X 1001

#### problem of 8 bit encodings above

After **switching languages**, wrong strings may be showed on screen because every encodings has their own characters; for example, the same bytes: `11000000` represents different characters in ISO/IEC 8859-1 (`À`) and ISO/IEC 8859-2 (`Ŕ`). Here comes **Unicode** to deal with this problem.

### Unicode (character set)

For example,

<div class="w-1/2 mx-auto">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/unicode_examples.png" alt="">
</div>

As you can see, these characters map to a string with 4 numberings by hexadecimal system. **Using hexadecimal system for character set does not mean it is 16 bit encoding.** We can use 32 bit, 16 bit, 8 bit encoding to encode a character set; for example, UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit) uses **8 bit and up to 6 bytes** to encode characters and can encode 1,112,064 valid character code points.

### UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8 bits)

The following 4 steps show how to find UTF-8 encoding according to unicode of particular character.

#### (step 1) Unicode

The unicode of `啊` is `u554a`

#### (step 2) Transfer to Binary

The binary of `554a` (Hexadecimal) is 101010101001010

#### (step 3) Insert into Encoding Table

Given the <a id="utf-8_principle" href="#utf-8_principle_example">UTF-8 table</a> in appendix, we need to use the row three; that is,

101010101001010 -> 0101 & 010101 & 001010 -> **1110**0101 **10**010101 **10**001010

#### (step 4) transfer back to Hexadecimal System

11100101 10010101 10001010 (binary) = E5 95 8A (hexadecimal) and save it.

### UTF-16 (Unicode Transformation Format 16 bits)

Again, UTF-16 follows following 4 steps

#### (step 1) Unicode

If unicode of character < 10000 (in hexadecimal system), then this unicode will be stored in memory with the unicode itself; for example, unicode of `啊` (`u554a`) will be stored in memory with `55` and then `4a` in big-endian and `4a` and then `55` in little-endian.

If unicode of character > 10000 (in hexadecimal system), then go on the following steps:

#### (step 2) Unicode minus 10000

`10A6F` (Hexadecimal) minus `10000` -> `0A6F`

#### (step 3) Transfer to Binary

`0A6F` -> 000000101001101111

#### (step 4) Insert into Encoding Table

Given the UTF-16 table in appendix

00 00000010 10 01101111 -> insert into 110110yy yyyyyyyy 110111xx xxxxxxxx -> 11011000 00000010 11011110 01101111

#### (step 5) transfer back to Hexadecimal System

11011000 00000010 11011110 01101111 (binary) -> D802DE6F (hexadecimal) and save it.

### UTF-32 (Unicode Transformation Format 32 bits)

Because encoding of 32 bit can save 2^32 (4294967296) characters, we can directly save the unicode in memory.

## What?

### UTF-8 dominates the web page world

</figure>

* Use Unicode -> UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32
* basic ASCII use 8 bits -> UTF-8 wins
* Endian issues -> UTF-8 wins

#### Endian issues

Given [Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness), the same Unicode may have different results in UTF-16 and UTF-32 because computers need to deal with the order of multiple bytes in these encodings; for example,

Unicode, `U+554a` comes and we need to tell computer to read it in order 55 and then 4a (big-endian) or 4a and then 55 (little-endian).

**UTF-8 does not have this kind of issue.**

### self-made character encoding

Steps: define a character set -> replicate encoding -> define mapping to Unicode

* define character set

### some other notes

`utf-8` in MySQL actually is not UTF-8 because it only support up to 3 bytes. `utf8mb4` in MySQL is UTF-8 because it support up to 4 bytes.

## Appendix

### the concept of bits

* most basic unit of digital communications
* possible value: 1 or 0
* example of 8 bit: 01011011
* in decimal system (10 進位): 01011011 = 91
* in hexadecimal system (16 進位): 01011011 = 5B

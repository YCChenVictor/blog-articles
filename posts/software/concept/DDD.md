# Title

## Purpose

To enable developers to create software that accurately reflects the real-world domain it serves, resulting in solutions that are more effective, maintainable, and adaptable to changing business needs.

## Concept

* Focus on the Domain: DDD places a strong emphasis on understanding the domain of the problem being solved. Developers work closely with domain experts to capture and model the domain concepts, behaviors, and rules accurately.
* Ubiquitous Language: DDD promotes the use of a shared language, known as the ubiquitous language, between domain experts and developers. This language helps ensure that everyone involved in the project has a common understanding of the domain concepts and can communicate effectively.
* Bounded Contexts: DDD encourages dividing large and complex domains into smaller, more manageable parts called bounded contexts. Each bounded context represents a specific area of the domain and can have its own models, rules, and language.
* Model-Driven Design: DDD advocates for building software systems based on domain models that closely resemble the real-world domain. These models capture the essential concepts, relationships, and behaviors of the domain and serve as a blueprint for the software architecture.
* Aggregates and Entities: DDD introduces the concepts of aggregates and entities to represent complex domain objects. Aggregates are clusters of related objects treated as a single unit, while entities are objects with unique identities and lifecycles within the domain.
* Domain Services and Repositories: DDD encourages the use of domain services to encapsulate domain-specific logic that doesn't naturally belong to any single entity or value object. Repositories are used to abstract the data access layer and provide a way to retrieve and persist domain objects.
* Event-Driven Architecture: DDD aligns well with event-driven architecture, where domain events are used to represent significant state changes within the system. These events can be used to trigger reactions in other parts of the system and maintain consistency across bounded contexts.
* Iterative Development: DDD supports an iterative and collaborative development process where the domain model evolves over time in response to changing requirements and feedback from domain experts and stakeholders.

## Example

There are two core domain entities

* Task: Represents a task in the system.
* User: Represents a user who can interact with tasks.

We'll use classes to represent these entities, and then we'll create a service to handle task-related operations.

```javascript
// Task entity
class Task {
  constructor(id, title, description, assigneeId) {
    this.id = id;
    this.title = title;
    this.description = description;
    this.assigneeId = assigneeId;
    this.completed = false;
  }

  markAsCompleted() {
    this.completed = true;
  }
}

// User entity
class User {
  constructor(id, name, email) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }
}

// Task service to perform operations
class TaskService {
  constructor() {
    this.tasks = [];
  }

  createTask(title, description, assigneeId) {
    const id = this.tasks.length + 1;
    const task = new Task(id, title, description, assigneeId);
    this.tasks.push(task);
    return task;
  }

  completeTask(taskId) {
    const task = this.tasks.find(task => task.id === taskId);
    if (task) {
      task.markAsCompleted();
      return task;
    }
    return null;
  }
}

// Example usage
const taskService = new TaskService();

// Creating users
const user1 = new User(1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
const user2 = new User(2, 'Bob', 'bob@example.com');

// Creating tasks
taskService.createTask('Task 1', 'Description for Task 1', user1.id);
taskService.createTask('Task 2', 'Description for Task 2', user2.id);

// Completing a task
taskService.completeTask(1);

console.log(taskService.tasks);
```

In this example:

We have Task and User classes representing domain entities.

TaskService class acts as a service to create and manipulate tasks. In Domain-Driven Design, application services often orchestrate interactions between domain objects to fulfill specific use cases or business logic. However, in MVC, the create method will be in the model of the Task. In DDD, the focus is on modeling the domain and organizing the codebase around domain concepts. While data persistence is still a concern, it's often handled by infrastructure layers outside the scope of the domain model. Therefore, in the DDD example, the createTask operation is placed within the TaskService to align with the domain-driven approach of encapsulating domain logic within application services.

Tasks are created with a createTask method and marked as completed with completeTask.
We maintain an array of tasks within the TaskService.

This is a basic demonstration of DDD principles in JavaScript, focusing on modeling domain entities and their interactions. Depending on the complexity of your domain, you may need to incorporate additional concepts such as aggregates, value objects, repositories, and domain events to fully apply DDD principles in your application.
